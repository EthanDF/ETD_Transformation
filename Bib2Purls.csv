The twelve-week, cardiovascular risk reduction program addressed nutrition, exercise, smoking cessation, disease prevention and stress management. The cardiovascular risk factors assessed included age, gender, blood pressure, weight, smoking, fasting glucose, cholesterol levels, and Framingham Risk Level. Subjects were 812 volunteer hospital employees made up of 505 Caucasians, 173 African-Americans, and 53 Hispanics. The pre-test to post-test changes in risk factor values for those at high risk for disease according to national guidelines all significantly decreased (p < 0.05). A significant overall decrease in the Framingham Risk Level occurred in these subjects. Results within the ethnic groups suggested that not all groups responded to the program in the same fashion or to the same degree.

Such a presentation, it was reasoned, would enable the student to gain successfully and thoroughly a background necessary for the further study of music theory. This would also provide an opportunity for the instructor to devote classroom time to more musical activities. In view of the past successes of others in the employment of programmed instruction as a means of teaching music, it was decided that a programmed presentation of the material to be included would best serve the stated purposes of the present study. Research into the area of the past employment of programmed instruction in music indicated that a need exists for additional work to be conducted in the field. A comparison of music theory textbooks was made to determine a consensus of opinion regarding the most logical order in the presentation of material. A study of programming techniques was made. A program of instruction in the basic tools of music theory was developed. The author combined information from various music theory textbooks with his knowledge of the subject matter to construct the program presented in chapters two, three, four, and five. The first section of the program is concerned with music notation, a subject often neglected in theory textbooks. The remainder of the program deals with basic music theory material of a more conventional nature. However, it was thought that this material might be more quickly and easily assimilated through the medium of programmed instruction, A section on the nature of musical sound provides necessary information for the music theory student. The same information presented in a classroom teaching situation, however, might prove less effective. Similarly, sections on the construction of major and minor scales, numbering of intervals, and notation of key signatures provide a means for the instructor of theory to avoid unnecessary use of class time in these less musicallysatisfying areas."

Professional literature relating to the discovery approach was reviewed and summarized. Conclusions and implications for music education were drawn from these summaries. An examination of the philosophical implications of educational trends and the nature of learning was also made. This examination was made to gather perspective on the need for evaluating and exploring educational approaches and methods that affect learning. It was concluded that no one method or approach can be accepted as the all encompassing answer in music education. However, the discovery approach does hold great promise as another way of teaching music to the child in a creative manner. Through the discovery approach the child can be given the opportunity to experience personal success and expertise in the art of music. He can enjoy exploring and discovering the elements of music as learning evolves from his personal perspective and point of view."

Total percussion is currently being taught in colleges and some of the larger high schools throughout the n tion. The total percussion class in the junior high school has no text or guide for the pupil or the teacher. Th author of this paper endeavors to present a text for the junior high school instrumental music teacher. The content have been tried during the last six years by the author and proven successful Student in many percussion classes have been taught to specialize on only one instrument. In many cases the teacher has found that specialization on snare drum or bass drum is a handicap when the student is asked to perform music written for other percussion instruments. The total percussion classes are usually composed of students who have the desire to become proficient on more th one percussion instrument. The instrumental music teacher should attempt to select students with a background in piano or some other melodic instrument, and enlist students with good physical coordination. A major criteria in the selection of a text for the total percussion class is the inclusion of basic fundamentals on all of the percussion instruments: bells, marimba, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals and tympani. Starting with the rote to note method, the teacher should lead the class into the fundamental stick positions, rhythmic counting, dynamics, and other basic problems of percussion instruments. At the end of the first year of study the students should be introduced to more advanced percussion such as trap sets and multi-percussion solos and ensembles. More complex rhythmic patterns are presented to the class in addition to an expanded repertoire. Musical independence and leadership is encouraged and critical observations of other students' performance as well as self criticism is developed. The total percussion class in the public schools is very new. More and more instrumental music teachers and band directors are arriving at the conclusion that the only solution to the demands of the contemporary composers on percussionists is the total percussion class. The author found that a text for the total percussion class for junior high school students was not available. It was with this thought that the author endeavored to write a text for junior high school instrumental music teachers who mi ght be interested in teaching a total percussion class."

Following a separate day to determine VO2 max, all subjects participated in two randomized test sessions (24-48 hrs apart). One session required the subjects to march (non-articulation) to music, taught via videotape, while their heart rate and oxygen consumption were measured. In another session, a foot articulation method was taught to all subjects, using the same marching task originally performed under the non-articulation condition. Articulation HR (114 $\pm$.7 bpm) and VO2 (11.11 $\pm$.142 ml/kg/min) were significantly (p $<$.05) higher than the non-articulation HR (108 $\pm$.7 bpm) and VO2 (9.98 $\pm$.132 ml/kg/min).

The procedure for obtaining the information necessary to complete this investigation was through extensive study and research from many books of several libraries. This type of investigation is based upon historical facts rather than philosophy and supposition. This investigation has revealed that the major periods of musical history are as follows: (1) Renaissance (2) Baroque (3) Classical (4) Romantic-Impressionism (5) Contemporary. The major types of sacred music that resulted from these periods are the Mass, oratorio, Passion music, cantata, sacred opera, anthem, chorale and motet. Some of the important conclusions of this investigation are that: (1) Each period is a product of the times, influenced by wars, religion and politics, which affected the types of music. (2) The classification of music in accordance with productions for concert, small and formal churches are as follows: Concert: Oratorios, Mass, sacred opera, Passion music. Formal Church: Mass, cantata, anthem, motet and chorale. Small Church: Cantata, anthem, motet, chorale and hymn. (3) Italy, France, England and Germany had the greatest influence on the types and styles of music. (4) The most significant types of music from these periods are the Mass and Oratorio (in that order). (5) The Renaissance produced the most sacred music of all these periods. (6) The Romantic period produced the least amount of sacred music of these periods. (7) The source of the major sacred works were mostly from the Bible; more specifically from Psalms and the Gospels. (8) Bach is the composer who has retained the most popularity and is significant in composing the largest number of sacred works throughout these periods. (9) Of the major composers listed in the thesis (excluding those of the Contemporary period), Liszt probably wrote the least amount of sacred music, although he was deeply concerned with the Divine Service of the Church."

In the past few years Distributive Education has seen the advent of the Interstate Distributive Education Curriculum Consortium (IDECC). This study dealt with an analysis of 76 jobs in distribution and the creation of Learning Activities Packages (LAP's) that would develop 983 technical competencies needed to master the 76 jobs. The competency areas developed included: advertising, communications, display, human relations, mathematics, merchandising, operations and management, product and service technology, and selling. Related to all other areas of instruction and to all competencies needed in distributive employment are certain economic understandings. These understandings should facilitate the distributive process by serving as a basis for management decisions and by enabling employees to comprehend the reasons for certain processes and procedures.

Time delay is a technique that transfers stimulus control from a controlling prompt (a prompt that results in correct task performance) to the discriminative stimulus (stimulus presented before a response can occur) by delaying the presentation of the prompt after the stimulus has been presented. During the initial trial, the delay between prompt and stimulus is at 0-seconds; during all other trials the delay is fixed at 4-seconds. Interspersal of known items is a method of sequencing unknown or target words among known words. Two sessions were provided each day in the classroom, one with constant time delay technique and the other with interspersal of known items as the training technique. The parallel treatment design was used to assess the efficacy and efficiency of the two strategies. The results indicate that both techniques were effective for students with LD. Constant time delay was significantly more effective than interspersal of known items for the students with MMR. Based on both the number of minutes of instructional time and the number of sessions through criterion, the constant time delay procedure was more efficient for students with MMR.

The scope is very broad and details will be found in books listed in the bibliography. All too frequently students study the development of music and the political history of Europe as two distinct and separate bodies of knowledge. The two, however, not only ran parallel, but were intertwined and interdependent. Often the ""why"" of a development or trend in music is explained by the political, social, and economic conditions that existed at the time. Since music, art, architecture, and literature are our only communication from the past, we are dependent on them to gain any insight into the political events and the attitudes and emotions of the people themselves. This facinating interaction is described by Henrick Van Loon in The Arts. In the outlines, the history progresses from one ruling monarch to the next with only the most significant events and people listed during specific reigns. The composers are listed chronologically by date of birth but are placed parallel to the events that occurred during their adult years. Outstanding composers are underlined in red. An index has been added to provide an easy reference to time and place in history."

The purpose of this composition was to explore the problems involved in composing and orchestrating an original suite for a saxophone quintet. The musical form of the suite was chosen since a form of many separate, yet harmonically linked, movements would bring out the greatest number of possible problems including style, orchestration, form, registers, function, characteristics of instruments, key consideration, tempos, change of meter, rhythmic devices, accompaniments, solos, voicings, and harmonic devices. The composition about to be discussed was written for five saxophones: two E flat alto saxophones, two B flat tenor saxophones, and one E flat baritone saxophone. The four movements of the suite are entitled: Allemande--written in 4/4 time, requiring a performance time of approximately 2:40 minutes. Courante--written in 3/4 time, requiring a performance time of approximately 2:30 minutes. Sarabande--written in 3/4 time, requiring a performance time of approximately 2:30 minutes. La Fine--written in 4/4 time, requiring a performance time of approximately 2:20 minutes. It is hoped that this suite will be a definite contribution to the saxophone literature. The instrumentalist who performs this suite will find very few dynamic marks, and, in some cases different phrasing may be used, thus allowing the performer more liberty and freedom of choice."

Subjects were 43 college student volunteers, predominantly female education majors, ranging in age from 21 to 44 years. Treatment consisted of a self-paced study period of up to 35 minutes, during which subjects in the mnemonic group studied hints linking place names to their map location, while subjects in the non-mnemonic group used their own best method to study. Place location tests administered immediately after the study period (acquisition) and one week later (retention) were compared between-groups using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Type I error probability of.05. The mnemonic group retained significantly (F(41,1) = 13.63, p $<$.002) more place locations than the non-mnemonic group. It was concluded that mnemonic strategies can facilitate the long-term retention of place location associations for college students."

Recently emphasis has turned toward discovering the new role music can play in the everyday lives of people in relation to use of leisure time. Since music has become an integral part of the curriculum, the purpose of this paper was to discover whether music contributes to the education of the educable mentally retarded, and if so, to what extent. Professional literature related to this subject was reviewed and summarized. The characteristics, problems, and family life of these children were discussed. Persons who teach mentally retarded children were interviewed to determine the nature of the problems involved in teaching these children music. Questions regarding the behavior of the students toward music, correlating music with other subjects, materials, length of music periods, curriculum content and other pertinent areas were asked the interviewees. After conducting an item analysis of the data secured from the interviewees, the researcher determined that: 1. Music opens the doors for the teaching of other subjects. 2. The characteristics of the retards should be kept in mind when planning lessons. 3. A variety of materials was used to assist in the teaching of music. 4. Mentally retarded children enjoy the same activities as other children, however, consideration must be given to their mental age and social maturity when planning lessons. 5. Music can be effectively used to promote social growth."

Additionally, the percent body fat values measured via near-infrared interactance (NIR), bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and skinfold (SF) were compared to HW to determine the validity of these measures. Thirty male, high school athletes (mean age +/- SD = 15.8 +/- 1.0 yrs) volunteered to have their % fat estimated. The findings from the present study indicated that the NIR and BIA instruments resulted in total error values that were too large to be of practical value (TE = 11.0 and TE = 6.5% fat, respectively). The BP (TE = 3.8% fat) produced acceptable measures (TE < 4.0% fat), but compared to all SF (TE = < 3.5% fat) estimations, BP was higher. These data suggest that the BP can produce acceptable body fat measures for male high school athletes, but is not superior to SF."

Teachers do not often have the creative ability or the time required to create their own materials; therefore, the author felt a need existed for an in-depth study of elementary music programs. The themes of the programs chosen were such that they correlate closely with social study units. Considerable research was conducted to find the most appropriate songs and dances from many sources. Vhen there were none, the author composed or created new material which was made available for elementary teachers. These programs may be adapted to meet the needs of individual schools. Teachers could modify or expand them to meet their own classroom situations. It was discovered that there was little related literature directed to the problem of preparing music programs for the elementary school. Dissertation Abstracts, issues of the Journal of Research in Music Education and Music Educators Journal were reviewed and it was found that an apparent void existed in this area.

At the present time there is an acute need for adequate material at this level. This condition exists primarily because of the following: (1) arranging perplexities due to lack of technical skills and lack of experience of high school band members, (2) uncertain standardized band instrumentation, (3) the neglect of publishers to meet their responsibilities, (4) the inability of composers and arrangers to write specifically for the senior high school band, and (5) the relative youth of the band movement as an adjunct to our culture. In orchestrating any original work, the scorer must recognize the many problems associated with a standardized instrumentation, the registers, functions of instrumental voices, key considerations, accompaniments, solos, and notation trends. In composing original material at the senior high school level, the composer must be aware of instrument ranges, writing technique, interpretation, and intonation problems of the band members; individually and within the section. Of utmost importance is the composer's entire knowledge and application of the forms in which he is writing. It is the sincere hope of this composer that this material may urge other composers to specialize in particular areas and levels of writing and furnish guidelines in study material for those who may discover similar problems in their endeavors."

A system of management for the model store laboratory is the missing element that must be provided before the model store can be a realistic approximation of that which it was intended to represent. There exists a subordinate need to provide an opportunity to develop interests for careers and provide experiences in the area of business services such as advertising, public relations and marketing research. These experiences are not now practicable within the scope of the model store. They are not generally provided for in the use the model store as learning experiences. Further, a need exists to provide a management plan for providing full-scale participation in all DECA activities.

How color is used in painting was categorized into five main modes which include the naturaluse of color, heraldic, harmonic, pure, and spiritual. Instances of color usage were f ound in the works of selected modern painters known as colorists. A dimension of increased awareness of color was demonstrated through the use of a color survey. This survey required individuals to express their feelings towards specific colors. The implications these findings have for teaching the art process were discussed.

Because of an enduring interest in the old rituals and the old ways; however, it might be said that the music of Judaism still contains small nuggets of the musical form used in the days of the Prophets. Certainly, in recent years, musicologists have shown increasing interest in reconstructing the ancient patterns. They have become more and more certain that the musical service of the temple, as initiated by David, was carried by the Judaeo-Christians to the early Christian church and was the basis of the music of the Catholic liturgy. The early modes, or scale patterns, of the Jews were closely related to those of the Greeks, the Egyptians, the Babylonians; the source was primarily Oriental. However, just as a new moral value made their religion unique, the Jews added an individual meaning to music that provided the foundation of Western musical style. When the people of Israel wandered all over the world during the past two thousand years, their music went with them. The scale patterns and melody patterns changed according to the ways of the particular country and the style of the day. Through the centuries the ""People of the Book"" made an effort to remember the old chants. At first generation after generation of priests chanted the Scripture and transmitted the musical tradition orally. Hand signals came into being to help remember the particular pattern and punctuation given each word. Many years later written symbols were substituted for the hand signals and each symbol represented a melodic pattern and mode. Slowly a more precise system evolved from this primitive writing until today's notation came into use. This particular musical service was based on ancient modal and melodic patterns. The portion of Scripture in which each response was found determined which mode or cantillation (chant) was used in the song. In many of the responses, the antiphonal or responsorial form was used for this form was one of the most common in the ancient Orient. As much as possible, the mode and cantillation chosen was that of the Yemenite, Babylonian, or Sephardic-Oriental sections of the Jewish world. These peoples, especially the Yemenites, remained relatively free of outside influences over the years and their music could be considered purer in style. The harmony was designed to combine the sound of an era when harmony was nonexistent with today's insistence upon harmonic variety. The whole of the service was written to provide listeners with a brief glimpse into ancient musical history, using a portion of the musical heritage given Western civilization by the Jewish nation."

This research study was designed to measure, within the State of Florida, commercial fitness instructors' knowledge base in exercise science, a knowledge base which relates to one's ability to deliver competent instruction. To determine adequacy of exercise science knowledge, test scores of commercial fitness instructors were compared to that of fitness instructors certified by the American College of Sports Medicine. It was hypothesized that commercial fitness instructors within the State lack appropriate training and, therefore, would not demonstrate a comparable exercise science knowledge base to ACSM instructors who have to meet requisite standards to become certified. Samples of commercial instructors were drawn from five geographically distributed, large metropolitan areas within the State; and their testing scores and those of an ACSM sample were statistically treated with One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ACSM instructors scored over twice as high as commercial instructors on the testing instrument; and ANOVA reflected a significant difference that supported the research hypothesis. It was concluded that commercial fitness instructors in the State of Florida have significantly less knowledge of exercise science than ACSM certified Health/Fitness instructors which lends credence to the concern that perhaps practicing instructors are incapable of delivering safe and effective exercise programming."

Match or mismatch of students' LSI profiles with their instructors' ISI profiles indicated whether learning approach was satisfied or not. Educational and statistical comparisons were made between the satisfied and the non-satisfied learners to determine differences in achievement and attrition among these subgroups. Students' expectations of achievement were correlated with their college grade point averages. Within academic areas correlational differences were significant only for two satisfied groups: independent teacher-paced science learners and lecture-laboratory English-reading learners. For all disciplines combined results favored the non-satisfied subgroups in independent teacher-paced and lecture, one exception favoring the satisfied lecture-laboratory learners. Satisfaction of learning experience had a more favorable educational rather than statistical effect: better grade percentages for satisfied students than those for non-satisfied students--two to one, fewer low grades and much less attrition. Results support the worth of using the LSI to match students with teachers for greater effectiveness."

Some children develop leadership and public speaking skills early in life. Some high schools and colleges emphasize public speaking. Adults frequently enroll in seminars such as Dale Carnegie programs or join organizations such as Toastmasters International. The researcher's own years of teaching and speaking experience have led her to believe in the potential value of public speaking for children, adults, and leaders in education organizations. Principals must speak competently and professionally. The purpose of this study was to determine how and when secondary school principals learned public speaking skills. The research also assessed their public speaking involvement and the importance they placed on public speaking for themselves, their staff, and their students. The researcher developed a questionnaire which was distributed to 101 middle and high school principals in Broward and Palm Beach county school districts in Florida. Completed responses were received from 52 principals. The most frequently cited-preparations for public speaking were college and high school courses. Public speaking skills were learned during high school and college years for 32 respondents. Only two had taken a Carnegie or Toastmasters course. Six principals said Carnegie or Toastmasters Youth Leadership type programs were offered in their schools, but 33 said they would be interested or wanted additional information. The principals most often cultivated public speaking skills by encouraging teachers to invite students to speak in class, inviting teachers and students to speak at assemblies, or by having drama clubs or debate teams. The last question was, ""How important is public speaking in what you do today?"" Very important was checked by 48 principals; somewhat important was checked by the remaining four respondents. The researcher believes that public speaking should be cultivated at all levels of education. Future research may consider whether resiliency of at-risk students could be enhanced by offering formal training in public speaking. The findings support the researcher's hypothesis that if school administrators recognize the importance of public speaking in their own experience, they are more likely to support its development among staff and students."

Specifically, the study examined the following: (1) the overall attitudes of male principals toward women, (2) their attitudes toward selected behavior traits, (3) their attitudes toward selected feminine barriers, (4) their attitudes toward selected manager traits, and (5) their overall attitudes toward women with relationship to five selected demographic characteristics: organizational level of employment, age, race, length of time in position, and school enrollment size. In order to assess the attitudes of male principals toward women, a questionnaire was mailed to 700 selected principals in public schools throughout the State of Florida. Of the 700 questionnaires mailed, 74 percent (517) were completed and returned. The questionnaire contained five demographic data items and twenty-one opinion statements which constituted the attitude scale. A seven step Likert-type scale was used to measure the strength of reported attitudes. The seven possible response choices for each item on the attitude scale were as follows: (1) strongly agree, (2) agree, (3) slightly agree, (4) neither agree nor disagree, (5) slightly disagree, (6) disagree, and (7) strongly disagree. Eleven of the opinion statements were positively directed so that agreement response choices indicated favorable attitudes toward women, and ten statements were negatively directed so that agreement response choices indicated unfavorable attitudes. In order to facilitate analysis of the data, each response choice was assigned a numeric weight which ranged from one to seven with the higher weights being assigned to the response choices that were more favorable toward women. Therefore, the higher a respondent's total score on the twenty-one opinion statements, the more favorable were his attitudes toward women. Analysis of the data clearly indicated that male principals in the State of Florida reported favorable attitudes toward women. Only 1.4 percent of the respondents expressed overall attitudes that were unfavorable toward women. A separation of the Women as Managers Scale into its three sub-elements indicated that 98.1 percent expressed favorable attitudes toward selected behavior traits, 90 percent expressed favorable attitudes toward selected feminine barriers and 97.5 percent expressed favorable attitudes toward selected manager traits. However, the intensity of favorable attitudes varied with each opinion statement. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients indicated that the relationship of the five selected demographic variables to male principals' overall attitudes toward women was not statistically significant at the .05 level. The principals' overall attitudes toward women aspiring to school-based administrative positions were not significantly related to their organizational level of employment, age, race, length of time in position, or their school enrollment size. The study concluded with the following recommendations: (1) The study should be repeated with the same target population using a different instrument; (2) An attitude scale should be developed that specifically measures attitudes of principals toward women; (3) Further research is necessary in order to determine if attitude difference exists due to sex of the principal or to the nature of attitudes unique to the principalship; and (4) A method of assessing attitudes of male principals that excludes the social desirability factor identified as prevalent in attitude questionnaires needs to be developed."

Attitude surveys were administered to 260 students from a high school, a junior college, and a university in Florida before and after instruction in introductory Spanish classes. A combination of instruments developed by Gardner and Lambert at McGill University was adapted for the study. A Likert-type scale was used to elicit responses regarding anomie, ethnocentrism, and attitude toward Hispanics; a semantic differential scale, to elicit stereotypes of Americans, Spaniards, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans. Data obtained were analyzed by one-way analyses of variance, correlation and t-tests for significance, and the orthogonal comparison method. Results included the following: The university students did not change attitudes significantly on any variable tested. The junior college students' attitudes improved significantly toward Mexicans. The high school students' attitudes toward Hispanics in general and toward Mexicans in particular declined significantly. For the total sample, there was a significant trend toward anomie following instruction, but there was no change in ethnocentrism. A significant positive relationship existed between these two variables prior to instruction; no significant relationship existed afterward. Stereotypes elicited rated Americans most favorably followed by Spaniards. There were no significant differentiations made between the other three groups. It was concluded that instruction in Spanish neither improved overall attitude toward Hispanics nor decreased ethnocentrism. Nevertheless, it was found that the high school students' attitudes were flexible and susceptible to change. Recommendations included the reassessment of affective goals in foreign language instruction and the development of cultural awareness units to be incorporated into the curriculum."

Prejudice is an attitude, usually unfavorable, toward individuals or groups, arrived at through an uncritical thought process and a disregard of the facts. Dogmatism, because of its connection with prejudice, vitiates students' chances for learning. Dogmatism in teachers creates an inequitable distribution of education to the extent that marginalized minority students are shortchanged educational opportunities. The nature of dogmatism and its impact on education is covered in the literature. Moreover, pedagogical and andragogical strategies which utilize the cognitive and affective domains to heighten critical thinking ability and empathy for others are also addressed in the literature., A Strategic Prejudice-Reduction Framework, the Dogmatism Diminution Model (DDM), was developed, implemented, and evaluated in a university setting. The DDM is not designed to be a discrete course; rather it is meant to be infused within a multicultural education class. The key features of the DDM are its domains, the Cognitive, Reflective, Emotive, and Active through which the course content is relayed. The Cognitive and Emotive domains of the DDM correspond to the cognitive and affective literature, the Reflective domain corresponds to the literature on critical thinking, but the Active domain of the DDM is not associated with the behavioral domain of the literature. Instead it is related to the research on service learning., Three hypotheses were tested. Two dealt with the DDM and the third with a demographic correlate of dogmatism. In order to determine the effectiveness of the DDM, Milton Rokeach's (1960) Dogmatism Scale was administered in a pretest/posttest design. The data were submitted to an ANCOVA and subsequently to a post hoc Scheffe test to determine between which pairs of groups differences in means occurred. ANCOVA was used to compensate for the effect that the pretest might have on the results of the posttest. The comparison of means among the four groups identified a significant reduction in the level of dogmatism at the alpha = .05 level between the DDM group and the Control group as well as one of the other two experimental groups. However, in a paired-score comparison of the treatment group itself, no significance was found with the sample of 31 subjects. This could be attributed to a lack of power in the sample size. Finally, a Pearson Product Moment Correlation of .154 was significant at the 95% confidence level between the variables of dogmatism and degree of religiosity."

Current first and second level German language textbooks used in high schools, community colleges, and universities in Florida were studied. The results showed that most cultural distortions involve bisexual and anti-artistic biases. Compared to older German language textbooks, today's materials manifest less bias and contain a greater variety of cultural selections. Since cultural distortions and biases could hinder the teacher's attempt to introduce the student to a well-rounded understanding of the German language and culture, several techniques could be applied to compensate for biases: 1. The teacher should call the student's attention to the generalizations and stereotyping found in the books. 2. The teacher should design his or her own material to be devoid of chauvinism. 3. Students should be encouraged to read German newspapers and magazines to be able to draw their own conclusions according to their abilities and maturity."

Literature reviewed for the study included current legislation with related legal and judicial mandates, the status and function of in-service education programs and the impact of change on staff development. Presentation was divided into four phases. The first phase was the three groups of individuals responsible for procedural compliance: school-based personnel, parents and other professionals. The second phase was the eferral of individual students. The third phase was the monitoring of reviews and reevaluations of students. The fourth phase was the status of chool-wide referrals. A chart was used to illustrate each of the phases in the plan. Each hart was immediately followed by a narrative description of the components in each phase. The plan was used for staff development during the inservice training of Exceptional Student Education Specialists for the 1981-82 school year, in the Broward School District. The plan was developed over a period of time beginning in 1976 and undergoing revisions based on legislation, court decisions, professional input and actual use in three different schools.

In addition, analyses were made to determine the relationships between isolated constructs of cognitive functioning and certain demographic variables. The initial expectation was that factor analysis would yield constructs aligned with constructs of cognitive functioning delineated by Piaget. It was also expected that the diagnosis would significantly distinguish between the three strata of subjects as the strata were formed on the basis of the subjects' past levels of academic performance. On the other hand, it was not expected that the diagnosis would be discriminatory in reference to other demographic variables studied. Observation of the results of the factor analysis confirmed the expectations regarding the Piagetian aligned factor structure of the diagnosis and offered a construct validity and reliability estimate of approximately .86. Observation of the results of the relational studies served to support the stated expectations except that measures related to three of the constructs were discriminatory along the dimension of sex. Twelve factors or constructs aligned with Piaget's theory were isolated. The constructs represented both a concrete operational and an abstract operational level of cognitive functioning for most of the cognitive tasks diagnosed. Seven of the factors discriminated significantly (p<.001) between the strata and, in all cases, discriminated in favor of stratum three, the stratum with highest past level of academic performance. The subjects in the stratum with the lowest level of academic performance, stratum one, and frequently stratum two subjects were functioning at a concrete operational level during the diagnosis. The important findings of this research necessitate immediate and continuous research of Piagetian remediation approaches based on the diagnosis and remediation of the learner's cognitive functioning abilities."

Subjects under study were one hundred fifty-nine men and women volunteers over the age of sixty who were participants at the eight Senior Centers of Dade County, Ida Fisher Junior High's Community School, or Broward Community College's Services for the Elderly Program. The instrument used to obtain the personal factors information (senior center, birthplace, ethnic group, sex, marital status, age, religious preferernce, number of children, income, former occupation, education) was a questionnaire devised by the investigator consisting of nineteen questions. The self concept assessments were obtained by using the Tennessee Self Concept Scale. The self concept scores which were used in this study were Total Positive, Self Criticism, Physical Self, Moral-Ethical Self, Personal Self, Family Self, and Social Self. The responses on the Tennessee Self Concept Scale and questionnaire were compared using a univariate analysis of variance for each personal factor as compared with each of the seven scores on the Tennessee Self Concept Scale for each subject. The results of this comparison were in terms of an F-test of analysis of variance, and the results were considered significant if they exceeded the .05 level. Additionally, data were graphed by senior center. Of the eleven personal factors which were investigated, six bore some significant relationship (at the .05 level) to one or more self concept scores of the subjects under investigation. These factors were senior center, sex, birthplace, educational level, ethnic group, and religious preference. When the data were graphed by senior center, it was found that Claude Pepper, Edison Courts, James Scott, Metropolitan, Smathers, and Ida Fisher senior centers had a similar Tennessee Self Concept Scale profile and similarities in the personal factors of birthplace, ethnic group, sex, marital status, religious preference, number of children, income, and education. Myers, Jollivette, and Malcolm Ross Senior Centers had similar Tennessee Self Concept Scale profiles and similarities in the personal factors of sex, marital status, number of children, income, and education.

In order to identify and compare evidence related to this purpose a survey questionnaire was sent to the counseling department in each college. The questionnaire was constructed to obtain data from these areas: (1) methods of recruitment, (2) identification of ethnic and economic categories included in disadvantagement, (3) methods of selection of students, (4) material aid given by college to disadvantaged students, (4) extent and effectiveness of vocational and occupational programs, (6) the present status of student retention, and (7) follow up programs on dropouts. The questionnaire was sent to five Florida Community Junior Colleges for their reaction and response. Three of the five respondents mentioned an imbalance in emphasis between recruitment and programs and between programs and retention. After consultation with an advisor, several more questions on programs were added to correct imbalance and add other pertinent information to the study. The questionnaire was sent to the 28 Florida Community Colleges and seven of their satellite campuses. Community Junior Colleges surveyed were identified by the 1971-72 edition of the American Association of Community Junior College's Directory. Of the 23 out of 35 questionnaires which were filled out by the community junior colleges, 18 were reported by major campuses and 5 were from satellite campuses, representing 64.3% of the total surveyed. Every questionnaire that was returned was utilized in the statistical analysis, and is reflected in the above percentage of those surveyed. Chapter II shows an analysis of data for the entire study and a preliminary discussion of recruitment and retention. The statistical treatment of the findings for recruitment and retention is given in detail. Chapter III reflects a preliminary discussion of programs, and the analysis of results of the programs now in operation for disadvantaged students. Chapter IV records final findings and implications. Major Conclusions and Implications: The Florida community colleges in fact have both diverse offerings and student populations. Documentation of the commitment to serve in general is more evident than research to determine specific opportunity for the disadvantaged. Special training programs are geared to the academic offering of the college with conservative emphasis on remediation. There seems to be an unwillingness to admit a need for institutional change, especially as programs relate to retention."

The study was conducted among 109 chief academic and student affairs administrators in two year colleges from five states who took the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the researcher's Relationship Satisfaction Survey. Oneway analysis of variance and the Selection Ratio Type Table were used to compare responses by groups of academic or student affairs administrators on MBTI scales of sensing or intuition and thinking or feeling. Oneway analysis of variance was also used to compare participants' responses to six items on importance and satisfaction scales of the Relationship Satisfaction Survey. The MBTI findings of the study indicated that academic affairs administrators were more likely than student affairs administrators to prefer intuition and student affairs administrators more likely to prefer sensing. Almost one half of the academic affairs administrators preferred intuition plus thinking, and almost eighty percent preferred intuition. The student affairs administrators' types were more diverse, with one third scoring as feeling types and over one half sensing types. These findings have an impact on the communication style that might be used by administrators when collaborating with counterparts of differing psychological types. The findings of the Relationship Satisfaction Survey indicated no significant difference between the two groups in their importance or satisfaction ratings of six aspects of the partnership. These aspects included agreement on resource allocation, agreement on policies and procedures, agreement on ethical principles and practices, effective listening by partner, general understanding and maintaining a collaborative working relationship. The means of the sums of importance and satisfaction scale scores for each group were similar, indicating both groups believed the items important and were satisfied with those aspects of their partnership. Conclusions related to the findings include suggestions to improve the communication between academic and student affairs administrators. Specific suggestions were given for each of the four MBTI functions of sensing plus thinking, sensing plus feeling, intuition plus thinking and intuition plus feeling. It is recommended that future research include larger studies, studies where participation is of a less voluntary nature and studies of matched pairs of administrators who work together."

The census data is readily accessible, easily obtained, simple to use, and virtually free. This study presented an innovative way to use census data coupled with business and educational practices as a marketing and planning aid for adult literacy education. The purpose of this study was to develop a model that utilized geo-demographic census data to identify and segment the adult low-literate population. The identification and segmentation of the adult low-literate population gives literacy educators the ability to plan literacy related educational programs and to market literacy education programs to a well-defined, well-understood population. Demographic data from the 1990 United States census was compiled for the number of adults age 25 and older living in each census tract of Broward County, Florida, and St. Louis County, Minnesota, who possessed low-literacy identifiers found by past national literacy surveys. School districts from the two study counties supplied records containing the locations and the ABE and adult ESOL programs offered at the adult literacy education sites. Combining the census findings with the school district records revealed several combinations of conclusions. Some geographic locations with high incidences of the low-literacy identifiers, as could be expected, contained adult literacy education sites. However, some geographic locations with high incidences of the low-literacy identifiers did not contain adult literacy education sites. In contrast, some areas with low incidences of the low-literacy identifiers contained several adult literacy education sites. A Pearson correlation involving the low-literacy identifiers found a positive relationship between each of the educational attainment variables, each of the language isolation variables and between the educational attainment variables and the language isolation variables. In Broward County, Florida, there was a moderate negative relationship between per capita income and the other low-literacy identifiers. In St. Louis County, Minnesota, there was a weak relationship between per capita income and the other low-literacy identifiers. A K-means cluster analysis of census tracts found nine homogeneous clusters in Broward County, Florida, and seven homogeneous clusters in St. Louis County, Minnesota. The model could be a beneficial planning and marketing aid for adult literacy programs in any geographic location. Included in this study are 40 data tables.

Mentoring was studied as a strategy to support the retention and development of school leaders. This phenomenological study focused on mentoring practices across multiple generations of educational leaders that had been successfully mentored. Selected mentors identified proteges whom they had mentored. The identification of mentors and proteges continued through five school leader mentoring generations. Each family consisted of five participants who had served as both mentor and protege. Each participant was asked open-ended interview questions about their roles as a mentor and as a protege. A total of 10 school leaders participated in this study. There were two interrelated research purposes of this study: (a) To understand the different meanings/practices of mentoring and being mentored, and further; (b) to explore whether there may be intergenerational patterns of mentoring that have been ""inherited"" by members of mentoring ""families."" In studying the relationship between mentoring and leadership development, the research design identified two distinct ""families"" of mentors and proteges. The significance of this design allowed the researcher to focus on ""inherited"" patterns of mentoring in order to better understand how mentoring might simultaneously promote cultural transmission and reproduction as well as the need for mutual and continuous learning. This study found that the cultural norms and values of Mentoring Family 1 and of Mentoring Family 2 were passed on from the first generation to the next through traditional mentoring and/or co-mentoring strategies. Mentoring strategies passed on from one generation to the next in both Family 1 and in Family 2 through mentors providing opportunities that opened doors that lead to advancement, socialization of proteges into new professional roles, and the development of trust and friendship. Role modeling and informal communication were the key learning strategies identified. These mentoring traits passed on relatively unchanged from one dyad to the next in both families."

The research was prompted by the need to evaluate the mutual acceptance of groups living in multi-ethnic communities and of the need of school administrators to be aware of any new needs the attitudes of each group may create within the school system. Studies reviewed from the literature concern psychological, sociological and educational aspects of bilingualism- biculturalism, the manner in which speech differences are given meaning and the phenomenon of stereotyping. The subjects were 195 students of Miami-Dade Community College, South Campus, Miami, Florida. Eighty-eight students were Anglo-Amnerican monolinguals, seventy-one were Cuban- American bilinguals and thirty-six were Anglo-American bilinguals. They were kept ignorant of the real purpose of the experiment and of the fact that they were listening to the voices of Cuban-American bilinguals in both of their language guises. The subjects evaluated the speakers using fifteen personality traits on seven point semantic differential scales. The basic data consisted of the differential scores for each subject on each of the fifteen personality traits representing the difference between the ratings of the combined Spanish guises and the combined English guises. A multivariate analysis of variance was performed and a Wilks' lambda test indicated significant differences in the differential evaluations of the groups. Correlated T tests of significance applied to each of the personality traits for each group separately revealed that Anglo-American monolingual students were strongly biased against Cuban-American students and that Cuban-American students show a bias against. their own language group. These reactions on the part of majority and minority group students confirm the results of similar studies made elsewhere. However, the beneficial effect of foreign language instruction is supported by the striking contrasts between the attitudes of the Anglo-American monolingual students and the Anglo-American students who had become bilingual. The fact that the latter show a marked preference for Spanish guises attests to the power inherent in bilingualism to encourage the breaking down of cultural barriers. It was concluded that although concomitant language learning does seem to relate to more positive attitudes toward the minority group, there is no evidence that the bilingual program in Miami, Florida, constitutes cultural maintenance for this Cuban-American group of students. Realizing that it would be unwise to generalize from the evidence provided by this study, it is felt, nevertheless, that these data can provide some insight toward understanding the cultural experience of the students of this multi-ethnic community for if their educational environment were truly pluralistic, more balanced attitudes should have been revealed in this sampling."

The statistical analyses yielded the following conclusions: (1) Management systems in special education schools fell into the Consultative Model, System 3 of Likert's management system. (2) The teachers in special education schools perceived their school's management system as effective. (3) There were significant correlations (r = .67) in mean scores between management systems and their measured effectiveness. (4) There were no significant correlations (r = -.085) between management systems and the level of education of the principals. (5) There were statistically significant differences between the teachers and the principals with regard to the perceptions of the management systems of the school.

Does the demand for graduates at the various levels described above depend on the size of the business measured by total employment? 5. Do the types of jobs available depend on the size of the business? 6. Do the starting salaries for these jobs depend also on the size of the business? 7. Do the opportunities for promotion likewise depend on the size of the business? 8. Is the job market the same within each type of industry regardless of the specific line of products made? 9. Do the employers expect a rapid expansion of their businesses in the next ten years? 10. What is the opinion of the employers on F.I.U., the faculty, and the graduates in general; and, in particular, on the proposed programs? To facilitate the answers to the above questions by the prospective employers, it was necessary to take the following prelininary steps: 1. To find out what programs were available at Miami-Dade and Broward community colleges. 2. To find out what programs had been developed by technical associations. 3. To define a proposal from each program based on existing courses offered at F.I.U. The population was categorized by type related to one of the proposed programs, and by size according to total employment. The investigation was carried out by personal interviews with industries selected at random. The results were as follows: 1. Local industry expects to hire candidates with an associate degree only in Manufacturing Technology. 2. Local industry expects to hire candidates with a bachelor's degree in any of the three proposed programs. 3. Local industry does not expect to consider for employment candidates with a master's degree. 4. The demand for graduates, the types of jobs available, the starting salaries, and the opportunities for promotion do not depend directly on the size of the business. 5. The job market does not depend on the specific line of products made. 6. The opinions on F.I.U. varied from one extreme to the other, and more public relations should be done to have a top image. Several other results were obtained from the investigation, beyond answers to the questions originally posed, which threw additional light on the problem, as follows: 1. There is another important job market for graduates in the proposed programs with firms doing consulting work for the local industry. 2. The proposed programs were unanimously accepted, and some suggestions were given as to topics to be stressed in some of the subjects. 3. Some students considered this type of research important because job opportunities were a prime factor in program selection."

The subjects were drawn from the 1997 Summer Orientation and Academic review (S.O.A.R.) enrollment at Florida Atlantic University. The researcher randomly assigned 23 at-risk student athletes to the control group and 27 at-risk student athletes to the treatment group. The treatment group received academic skills instruction supplemented with multiple modalities sensitive instructional techniques congruent with the methodologies and philosophies of accelerated learning. All subjects completed a demographic survey on the first day of class. On the second day of class, the treatment group completed the Learning Style Inventory (LSI)/Productivity Environmental Preferences Survey (PEPS), a comprehensive assessment of an individual's learning style. The results of these surveys, in conjunction with the students' daily program evaluations, were used to determine the best, most conducive plan for classroom activities and teaching techniques. A 2 x 2 factorial ANOVA was performed to determine the existence of a main effect for instructional method on retention, GPA, and fall enrollment. ANCOVA was performed to determine the effect of the variables above the extraneous covariates. Neither procedure resulted in any statistical significance. The discriminant analysis of 50 unweighted cases revealed that the model is overall 86% accurate for both the original grouped cases and the cross-validated cases. The model is 90.7% accurate for predicting group membership for retention and 51.7% accurate for predicting group membership for no retention. This is an initial study which provides adult educators with data and reproducible methodology in order to further explore and improve teaching techniques for student athletes."
