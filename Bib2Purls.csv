In particular, this study empirically examines the different valuation weights that capital market participants attach to accrual-based versus cash flow-based measures when valuing intangible-intensive, high-technology stocks, and finds that investors appear to value, on average, a dollar of cash flows higher than a dollar of accruals for intangible-intensive high-technology firms. Based on samples of Compustat high- and low-technology firms between 1992--2001, the empirical results suggest that cash flows have larger multiplier than aggregate accruals, and have incremental value-relevant information beyond that contained in the individual components of accruals for valuing high-technology stocks. This study further provides evidence that suggests that cash earnings measures of low-technology firms are dominated by those of high-technology firms as a summary indicator of share values. This study contributes to existing literature that reports no substantial difference in the value relevance of cash flow and accrual amounts in high and low tech industries. It provides evidence that suggests that capital market investors do not hold high-tech stocks to the same standards of valuation that they use for low-tech traditional stocks."
027272295,(OCoLC)76920976,http://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/12207,"This study examines whether there are any significant differences between accounting students enrolled in Internet-based courses and accounting students attending campus-based courses in terms of self-efficacy, academic goal, anxiety, gender, and self-assessment of performance. The study is motivated by the many calls for research to apply social cognitive theory to determine factors of motivation and consequently success of accounting students in an online education environment. Social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) is used to develop the hypotheses tested in the current study. Three groups of hypotheses were developed. The first group of hypotheses tests the relationships among academic self-efficacy, computer self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy, and academic goal. The second group of hypotheses tests the relationships among academic self-efficacy, computer self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy, computer anxiety, Internet anxiety, gender and instruction mode. The third group of hypotheses tests the relationships among academic self-efficacy, academic goal, computer self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy, computer anxiety, Internet anxiety, gender, instruction mode and self-assessment of performance. The study's results support the hypothesis that Internet self-efficacy is a significant predictor of whether accounting students will enroll in campus-based courses or Internet-based courses when they have the choice of instruction mode. The results also indicate that gender is a significant predictor of instruction mode. Moreover, the results indicate that academic self-efficacy is a significant predictor of accounting students' academic goals. Finally, the results indicate that computer self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy, academic goal, academic self-efficacy, computer anxiety, and Internet anxiety are significant predictors of accounting students' self-assessment of performance."
027286704,(OCoLC)77006292,http://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/12191,"This paper examines the association between the employment of industry specialist auditors, and the degree of information asymmetry and the cost of debt of a client company. Unlike auditors without industry expertise, auditors with industry expertise can better improve the credibility of financial statements (Krishnan 2003; Balsam et al. 2003) and verify management forecasts, thereby minimizing management's discretion in applying accounting principles and standards (Kwon 1996). This suggests that industry specialist auditors can enhance audit quality. Consequently, clients of industry specialist auditors are expected to achieve more significant economic benefits than clients of nonspecialist auditors. Based on product differentiation theory and signaling theory, it is hypothesized in this study that clients of industry specialist auditors are more likely to enjoy a lower level of information asymmetry and a lower cost of debt than clients of nonindustry specialist auditors. In addition, this study hypothesizes that the marginal economic value added by auditor industry specialization varies between financially troubled clients and financially healthy clients that seek external financing. The results indicate that clients of specialists experience a lower information asymmetry level than clients of nonspecialists. This economic value provided by specialists is important and more pronounced for unregulated firms than for regulated firms. This inference, however, does not hold when information asymmetry is measured using analyst forecast dispersion. In addition, clients hiring specialists enjoy better credit ratings and lower cost of debt than clients of nonspecialists, and this economic value is more significant for financially troubled firms than for financially healthy firms. However, these findings do not hold for each proxy of auditor industry specialization."

The motivation for this study arises from ongoing accounting harmonization efforts to increase the comparability of financial reporting across countries. Proponents of harmonization agree that investors support the need for comparability. Opponents, on the other hand, argue that efforts toward a common set of accounting standards worldwide may not achieve comparability as long as economical, cultural, and political differences exist across countries. So, the question is whether the application of common accounting standards result in enhanced comparability of financial statements, given that firms operate in different countries with different regulatory and cultural influences. This study examines the relationship between reported financial figures and both stock prices and returns across Saudi, Kuwait, the U.S., and U.S. listed firms that use international accounting standards (IAS-sample) to determine whether there are differences in the value relevance of their accounting numbers. Saudi and Kuwait have similar environments. However, they use different GAAPs. Saudi uses U.S. GAAP and Kuwait uses IAS. As a benchmark, this study uses samples of firms that use U.S. GAAP, and that use IAS, with both samples listing in the U.S. capital market. To determine whether accounting standards play a large role in differences in value relevance across these countries, four comparisons are performed: (1) Saudi and the U.S.; (2) Kuwait and IAS-sample; (3) Saudi and Kuwait; and (4) the U.S. and IAS-sample. The results show that there are significant differences in the value relevance between countries that apply the same standards but have different institutional factors. On the other hand, there are no significant differences, in most cases, in the value relevance between countries that apply different standards but operate in a similar environment. Moreover, this study attempts to determine whether earnings conservatism differs across these countries. This study provides evidence that institutional factors affect the differences in earnings conservatism. The findings of this study suggest that international harmonization of accounting standards may not be easily accomplished because institutional factors play an influential role in information dissemination."

Specifically, the study tests whether a significant positive change exists in the market reaction to acquisitions qualifying for the Internal Revenue Code section 197. Two methodologies are employed in the examination of the market assessment of the effect of the Internal Revenue Code section 197. First, a market model methodology is utilized in order to pre examine whether the market reacted differently to acquisitions that qualified for goodwill tax deductibility relative to acquisitions that did not. Second, multiple regression models were obtained for testing the study's hypotheses. The results of this study support the hypothesis that a positive change exists in the market reaction to acquisitions that qualify for the internal revenue code 197 relative to those that do not. There are two implications for these findings. First, they imply that acquiring firms did retain some of the tax benefits associated with the change in the tax law. Second, and given the findings of previous studies, the findings of this study also imply that the expected tax savings are actually shared between the acquiring firm and the target's shareholders."

National level indicators are scantily represented in IT adoption or diffusion theory. Empirical results on this are almost absent in literature. Diffusion theory models of Rogers (1985) and Kwon and Zmud (1987) do not address national level attributes. National level indicators like culture, economy, institutional factors, physical distance from the innovating nation, IT infrastructure etc., could all be relevant to IT diffusion. Three types of major models (models based on adoption and growth rate factors and diffusion rate) are introduced and the effects of national indicators are examined. First, a general model is developed showing the relationship of various national factors with IT adoption and growth rate. The adoption and growth rates of nine IT products/paradigms are examined in context of the model posited. The hypotheses tested include: (1) IT adoption and growth rate is related to national value systems based on Inglehart's and Hofstede's dimensions, even after controlling for major economic and other indicators; (2) IT adoption and growth rate is related to economic as well as institutional and other national level factors; (3) The factors of adoption and growth rate of IT products/phenomena are different for different products/paradigms. Next, non-linear (temporal as well as space-time) diffusion models are used for modeling the diffusion process. For this purpose, mathematical models are developed and assessed. These models provide additional contributions in the area of diffusion model development. Time-series data on various countries are researched and gathered for this purpose. Preliminary empirical results show support for the hypothesis that national level indicators do exert influence on growth and diffusion of various IT products and paradigms."

However, influences of trust on intentions to provide personal information to complete the transaction, and influences of trust in the product category, and/or in the brand, on intentions to transact, have received little attention. This research fills the gap in the exiting literature by understanding the influence of product category trust, brand trust and vendor trust on intentions to transact online, a combination of intentions to purchase and intentions to provide personal information to complete the transaction. Hypotheses of the influence of the trust variables on intentions to transact were tested using a computer simulated Internet web-site and two products in a 2 (product trust) x 2 (brand trust) x 2 (vendor trust) between-subject factorial design with replication, and a sample of 422 subjects. Findings suggest that channel trust still influences online intentions to transact and that product category trust, particularly for product categories with low past experience, also influences online intentions to transact. Additionally, findings also suggest that brand trust may be as important as vendor trust in influencing online intentions to transact. Findings suggest that Internet vendors will benefit from carrying trusted brands and from increasing consumer trust towards the Internet as a shopping channel."

This dissertation examines the takeover and divestiture activity in high-tech markets in an effort to extend our current knowledge regarding high-tech companies. In that context, various firm characteristics and their relation to firm performance are investigated. Furthermore, an attempt is made to examine the role of investment banks and their impact---if any---on shareholder wealth. This study finds that for domestic high-tech acquisitions, the higher the level of the target's R&D expenditures, the lower the bidder's announcement period wealth effects. Furthermore, the more MEDIA attention the tech target receives prior to the acquisition the more favorably investors react to news about the acquisition. This finding is common both for domestic and international tech acquisitions. Findings on the role of investment bank advisors vary across the three studies. Essay 1 shows that high-tech acquisitions advised by top-tier investment banks perform worse upon announcement than acquisitions advised by lower-tier investment banks. In Essay 2 the tier of the investment bank advisor makes a difference only during the difficult and uncertain years of the tech downturn time period. Finally, in Essay 3 it is found that sellers benefit from the presence of an investment bank advising the buyer, suggesting that whenever the buyer uses an investment bank, the assets are divested at a high price. However, it is only during the years following the end of the tech-bubble period that buying-firm shareholders reacted less favorably to acquisitions of high-tech divested assets certified by an investment bank."

Because closed-end funds trade at market prices different from net asset value (NAV) they are used to test both the performance persistence of their NAV and market price returns. While research has assessed the performance persistence of open-end funds, it has not assessed the performance persistence of closed-end funds. Yet, the unique characteristics of closed-end funds allow stronger arguments for their persistence than the arguments previously submitted for open-end funds. The characteristics that can potentially cause closed-end fund return persistence to be different from open-end fund return persistence include investor sentiment, restrictions on liquidity of underlying assets and cash holdings, and performance pressure on fund managers. This study also investigates the NAV and market price return persistence of international closed-end funds. This group of funds is of particular interest because investor sentiment determines a large portion of the market price return. In addition, as some international markets are less efficient due to restricted flow of information, fund managers may have an advantage in portfolio selection. Finally, this study examines cross-sectionally whether the persistence measure is related to the fund characteristics size, goal, management fees, turnover, fund family, fund experience, and the stock exchange a fund is traded on. The results show evidence for NAV and market price performance persistence, which is stronger for past winning than losing funds. NAV return persistence is less for foreign than domestic funds, possibly due to exchange rate fluctuations. However, market price return persistence is greater for foreign than domestic funds, which may indicate that price pressure is affecting foreign funds more than domestic funds. Funds with lower expense ratios, funds that are not members in a fund family, and funds traded on the NYSE show more persistence of strong NAV and market price performance. The results imply that investors should benefit from investing in past winning funds. This is particularly true for foreign funds, funds with lower expense ratios, funds that are not members of a fund family, and funds traded on the NYSE."

The introduction of the single European currency, the euro, eliminated a traditional source of risk to international portfolio investors. In light of these developments, Part I of the empirical analysis had the following objectives: (1) to determine the relative importance of country, sector, and industry factors in explaining individual company's stock return behavior in the wake of the formation of the European Union, (2) to identify the multiple factor model, consisting of country and/or sector and/or industry factors, that was best at explaining European stock returns over the observation period, (3) to discover cross-sectional differences and non-stationarity in the industry portfolio return sensitivity to country, sector, and industry factors, (4) to find out whether the European market had become more independent from the other two major trading areas, the US and the Pacific Rim, over the period 6/1994 to 6/1999, and (5) to quantify industry structure-related changes in portfolio diversification benefits in European stock portfolios. Diversification benefits of country portfolios still outweighed diversification benefits of European industry portfolios. However, evidence was found for a gradual change in the degree of homogeneity within European industries in the wake of the ongoing harmonization of European financial markets. It seems reasonable to assume diversification effects in the future to become even more pronounced for portfolios generated within a country market but across industries. The main objective of Part II, was to determine the valuation effects of merger and acquisition announcements on national rivals (intra-industry effects) and European rivals (inter-country effects). Conducting various cross-sectional return analyses, country and industry-specific sources of intra-industry effects and inter-country effects were identified. With the elimination of foreign exchange rate risks, following the introduction of the single currency on January 1, 1999, cross-border spillover effects have become more pronounced. The hypothesis that the introduction of the euro facilitates the transmission of (private) information across geographic markets boundaries is clearly supported by the findings of the cross-sectional regression analysis."

Two primary research questions are addressed: (1) What are the wealth effects associated with divestiture of foreign and domestic subsidiaries? (2) How do firm-specific and macroeconomic conditions affect these wealth effects? Various methodologies are used to empirically test theories and hypotheses. Two samples of divestitures that occurred between 1979 and 1991 are used. One sample consists of 111 divestitures of foreign subsidiaries by U.S. firms, and the other sample consists of 148 divestitures of domestic subsidiaries by U.S. firms. The results of this study are relevant to corporate managers, investors, security analysts, and other researchers. Foreign and domestic divestitures elicit positive short-run valuation effects of about 1 and 2 percent respectively. In the long run, firms that divest foreign subsidiaries increase in value on average by about 15 percent over a 5 year post-divestiture period. Conversely, firms that divest domestic subsidiaries decrease in value on average by about 11 percent over the 5 years that follow divestiture. No significant change in firm risk is associated with foreign or domestic divestitures. Relations between short-run and long-run valuation effects in the sample of domestic divestitures are positive and significant for periods of up to 4 years after divestiture, but for foreign divestitures, such relations are not significant. This suggests that the market adjusts more slowly but seems to more accurately predict the long run impact of domestic divestitures. Large divestitures elicit large valuation effects. Financially strong firms divesting foreign subsidiaries experience less favorable valuation effects. Greater valuation effects result from divestiture of unrelated subsidiaries. Strategic divestitures elicit positive valuation effects in the short run but little unique effect in the long run. Domestic divestitures that occur because of liquidity problems elicit positive valuation effects. Larger valuation effects are associated with divestiture of foreign subsidiaries in industrial countries than in less developed countries. A strong U.S. dollar seems to have a positive influence on short-run valuation effects but no material influence on long-run valuation effects associated with foreign divestiture."

This study proposes Net Transaction Value (NTV), a unified theory of buyer decision-making. NTV hypothesizes that a buyer makes an implicit and subjective calculation before making a purchase in a high involvement context. In making this calculation, the buyer deducts the costs anticipated from a transaction or transaction stream from its associated benefits. Benefits in the NTV equation reflect not only the product or service offering itself, but the monetary aspects of the transaction or purchase deal. Costs reflect the buyer's own self-imposed costs over and above price as well as those costs over and above price imposed by the seller on the buyer. This study uses the NTV model to develop and test the relationships between these benefit and cost variables and the buyer's perceptions of net transaction value. Results confirm that the buyer includes the benefits of the product or service offering itself and seller-imposed costs in the calculation of NTV. As a result, NTV provides a valuable tool for predicting and describing buyer decision-making."

To better understand what influences consumers' choices to shop for products or services on the internet versus local retail stores, this study tests the influence of consumers' transaction costs, coupled with the risk-bearing propensity of individuals (risk-taking or risk-averse attitude) in a shopping context, and the category of goods involved in the purchase process (such as search or experience goods), which will ultimately influence consumers' preference of shopping medium (such as online or traditional). This research study introduces the construct of consumers' transaction costs as an important predictor of consumers' preference of shopping medium, develops two segregated categories of consumers' transaction costs, namely the individual costs and the social costs, and implements a system of measurement of these costs with regard to how much they matter to individual consumers with regard to their preference of shopping medium. Several pretests were initially conducted to operationalize the variables and their measurement scales, and to validate the manipulation checks employed for the study. The data for the main study was then collected via four versions of the designed and pre-tested survey instrument, employing a between-subjects design, and subject to the appropriate statistical analyses. The results convey that individuals with higher risk-bearing propensity would prefer the online shopping medium, while individuals with lower risk-bearing propensity would prefer the traditional shopping medium. Further, search goods would have a greater tendency to be bought online, while experience goods would have a greater tendency to be bought in-store. These findings bear support to past literature wherein similar results have been found, and serve to strengthen these conjectures. With regard to the effects of consumers' transaction costs, the individual costs and the social costs tend to only influence consumers' reference of shopping medium without providing a sense of the actual choice of medium. Further, the nonsignificant interaction effects of individuals' risk-bearing propensity and goods' categories with consumers' transaction costs imply that these variables do not moderate the impact of transaction costs on consumers' preference of shopping medium. The study then discusses the analytical and theoretical reasoning pertaining to these results, along with the managerial implications which this research bears, and the limitations of this study which could warrant potential future research."

The primary research objective deals with strong-form market efficiency. The test strives to determine if the results of information held by investment bankers are attributable to inside information or information that is available to anyone willing to research and analyze particular target firms. A second research objective is to examine why larger wealth effects are expected. Potential reasons examined include internal and external governance issues, as well as acquisition activity as a means of governance. Specific issues examined are (1) a change in the chief executive officer after acquisition, (2) a change in the board of directors after acquisition, (3) an increase in the debt ratio of the target firm after acquisition, (4) downsizing and/or exiting from an industry after acquisition, and (5) to stop the selection of poor acquisitions by the target firm. The relative size of the acquisitions is controlled for in both groups; economies of scale realized from horizontal or vertical acquisitions are controlled for in the case of the control group. A comparison of the wealth gains between the two groups reveals that investment bankers outperform non-investment bankers when the average holding period abnormal return is used as the wealth measure. However, when cumulative average abnormal returns are compared, the non-investment banker group realizes higher wealth gains than the investment bankers. In no case does either group outperform a market index, the S&P 500. The results of the wealth effect tests support strong-form market efficiency; investment bankers do not utilize private information to realize gains from closely-held information. Primarily, downsizing is associated with positive effects on the stock price returns of target firms in partial acquisitions by investment bankers. Non-investment banker partial acquisitions are characterized with a change in the chief executive officer of the target firm. This change, however, is negatively associated with the share price returns of the target firms."

This study measures this decision by analyzing the state Division of Tourism estimates for visitors in light of changes in; national gross domestic product, non-aviation gasoline prices, average airfares, and exchange rates. This data was compiled on a quarterly basis form 1980 to 1993 and analyzed by employing Translog and Cobb-Douglas demand functional forms for use in regression analysis. Based upon the regression results, the Cobb-Douglas functional form best represents what has historically occurred in the real economic world and follows generally accepted micro-economic demand theory. The Cobb-Douglas techniques reveal that an economic agents' future income expectations, measured by GDP levels, has a significant influence on Florida visitor estimates and has a role in the decision to vacation in Florida."

The Williamson asset specificity hypothesis asserts that the financial leverage used by firms is a function of the specificity of the assets owned by the firm when asset specificity is defined as the readiness with which assets can be re-deployed. This results from a governance argument whereby highly specific assets can only be governed by increased equity participation. This argument is extended with the assertion that increased specificity causes operating leverage to rise and that firms counter this increased operating leverage by decreasing the financial leverage they employ. Liquidation value is employed as a proxy measure for how readily assets can be converted to cash. Data was gathered for a sample of firms who have liquidated and include firms liquidated in bankruptcy and firms liquidated voluntarily. Using these data a model is developed to estimate the liquidation value of any firm. A cross-sectional time-series formulation is employed using data gathered for thirty-six firms over a twenty-two year period. A statistically significant positive relationship was found to exist between the estimated liquidation value and financial leverage which supports the Williamson asset specificity hypothesis. Neither the cross-sectional nor time series behavior of firms provides evidence of a trade-off between interest tax shields and non-debt tax shields. No significant relationship was found to exist between the value of the non-debt tax shield and financial leverage. No evidence was found indicating a relationship between operating leverage of firms and financial leverage. However, evidence was found that firms with higher percentage changes in sales from year to year, lower probabilities of failure, higher levels of financial slack, and lower values for interest tax shields use less financial leverage. Finally, evidence was found indicating that firms employed more financial leverage in the 1980's than in the 1970's."

The firms (Forbes-CEOs of the largest 800 public companies) had the same CEO for the entire period. The resource allocation decisions and the measures of firm performance (ROA, ROE, ROI, ROS, cashflow/sales, and stock return) were obtained from COMPUSTAT. The number of acquisitions was obtained from Mergers and Acquisitions. The percent of CEO compensation at risk was found to be associated with the change in R&D and the change in the number of business segments. Total CEO compensation was found to be positively associated with the change in advertising expenses, the change in the number of employees, and the change in the number of acquisitions. A principal components analysis indicated that the performance measures loaded on two factors, representing firm profitability and returns to stockholders. The relationship between CEO compensation and firm performance was explored using two stage simultaneous equations. The model considered the effects of prior firm performance on the relationship. The amount of total CEO compensation and the percent of CEO compensation at risk were found to be positively associated with subsequent firm profitability for several years. Total CEO compensation and the percent of CEO compensation at risk were positively associated with subsequent return to stockholders in one year.

The main goal of the first study is to determine the effect of some corporate governance-related variables on bank initial public offerings (IPOs). The testable hypotheses involve three dependent variables: abnormal offer price, initial return or underpricing, and long-term performance. The proposed independent variables have no explanatory power on the cross-sectional variation of the abnormal offer price. The proportion of outside directors, the size of the bank, directors and officers' (D&O) equity based compensation plans, and the age of the bank, all have a positive relationship with the level of underpricing. The variables, nominating committee independence, directors' knowledge and experience, and directors' reputation, have the hypothesized positive relationship with the sample's long-run performance. The main goal of the second research work is the analysis of a sample of self-underwritten IPOs. The analysis includes the IPOs' underpricing; long-term performance; lockup and quiet period; risk; volume; and failure and acquisitions. The main result of this study is that here are no significant differences on the level of underpricing between self-underwritten IPOs and conventional IPOs underwritten by independent underwriters. The only significant result about the long-run performance of self-underwritten IPOs is on the subsample of nonpenny stocks, where the larger the firm the lower the long-run performance. The third research work focuses on going private transactions of financial institutions. This study includes the analysis of the cross-sectional differences of the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) that result from the public announcement of a going private transaction proposal. Similarly, this study tests the long-run performance and the risk change of those firms that stay public after the withdrawal of a going private transaction. The main results suggest that public announcement of a going-private transaction produces positive CARs of about 15 percent. The public announcement of the withdrawal of a going-private transaction generates negative CARs between -4 percent and -5 percent. The total risk of the sample with respect to the matching group experiences a positive and significant increase after the public announcement of a going-private transaction proposal."

025330671,(OCoLC)41556774,http://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/12515,"This research examines the impact of differential power on the choice of monitoring mode in interorganizational relationships in marketing channels. Interorganizational relationships in channels of distribution can be considered agency relationships because they involve delegation of value-adding tasks by one participant (principal) to another participant (agent). Moral Hazard or the likelihood of an agent pursuing individual goals at the expense of mutually satisfying common goals may result in suboptimal outcomes and necessitates monitoring by the principal. Monitoring involves procuring information on the effort expended by the agent (behavior-based monitoring) and the resultant outcomes of such efforts (outcome-based monitoring). A comparison of purely economic costs in determining preferred monitoring mode without considering sociopolitical factors, such as organizational power, that influence these costs may lead to an erroneous choice of monitoring mode. An organization's power is its ability to cope with uncertainty and depends on the resources available to the organization. As resources shift from one participant to another in an agency relationship, the differential power of participants changes. This research examines how the differential power of principal and agent influences their preference for different monitoring modes. Hypotheses linking differential power, moral hazard, and the choice of monitoring mode in interorganizational agency relationships are empirically investigated with data from not-for-profit nongovernment food distribution systems established to feed the hungry. Confirmatory factor analysis is used to analyze the data and estimate measurement and structural models. All the measurement scales were developed specifically for this study and display excellent psychometric properties. Results from structural models are generally consistent with the theoretical rationale. The results indicate that higher levels of principal's propensity to assume risk result in principal preferring an outcome-based monitoring mode. Higher level of principal's accrued information lead to an outcome-based monitoring mode being preferred by the principal. Higher level of agent's accrued information lead to the principal preferring a behavior-based monitoring mode and the agent preferring an outcome-based monitoring mode. Use of side payments as incentives to align the preferred monitoring modes of the participants finds support. The findings of this study have implications for managers and public policy officials in making strategic decisions regarding performance evaluation of downstream organizations in order to ensure optimal outcomes."

One of regulators' most recent attempts to shore up auditor independence is evident in the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). As a test of two competing theories of auditor independence, and to determine whether SOX mandates have successfully enhanced financial reporting quality, I examine post-SOX changes in non-audit fees (as a proxy for changes in quasi-rents) and the extent of changes in two measures of financial reporting quality. Results suggest that SOX mandates have been effective, and that the proposition of DeAngelo (1981b) that non-audit services may impair auditor independence may more-closely describe the relationship between changes in quasi-rents and changes in financial reporting quality than does the theory of Lee and Gu (1998). Further, supplemental analyses suggest that, as proposed by the theories, the amount of low-balling is positively related to the amount of quasi-rents."

This recent rise in mergers and acquisitions has prompted interest in what characteristics make certain hospitals good takeover targets. This study compares hospital and regional differences between 11 acquired versus 296 non-acquired hospitals in Texas one year prior to takeover in 1995. A stochastic frontier model and PROBIT model were used to determine which characteristics suggest takeover likelihood. The findings indicate that inefficiency is highly significant in predicting which hospitals make good takeover candidates. Hospitals in counties with large populations and with a large senior citizen community are also significant indicators of potential acquisition. The results suggest that these acquisitions are a market mechanism for disciplining inefficient hospitals.

All data sets were found to contain a unit root. Further, there was no evidence for cointegration between the exchange rate and any of the explanatory variables (US interest rates, Japanese interest rates, and the interest rate differential). However, Granger-causality was discovered between the interest rate differential and the exchange rate.

Auditor quality is measured using reputation, industry specialist and tenure metrics. The underlying assumption is that auditor quality enhances the market's perception of firm value; as such, auditor quality may mitigate the cost of security mispricing documented by Richardson et al. (2005) for low or medium reliability accruals. The results of the study provide some support that high quality auditors contribute to the valuation of equity for assets.

To better understand what influences consumers' choices to shop for products or services on the Internet versus local retail stores, this study tests the influence of antecedent factors of consumer patronage intentions for Internet and local retail stores. The study draws the antecedent factors from the extant literature, which include product classes, the importance consumers place on retailer attributes, and consumer perceived risk in product classes. Because the Internet instituted a convenient shopping medium with information distribution and search capabilities, nomological validity of the search, experience, and credence (SEC) product classification framework is tested in the online shopping context. This study tests the validity of the SEC product classification framework by examining whether significant differences exist in (1) the level of importance that consumers place on retailer attributes, (2) the amount and type of risks that online shoppers perceive in product classes (search, experience, and credence), and (3) their patronage intentions for two retailer types---Internet and local retail stores---based on product classes. In the same model, the study also tests the mediating effects of perceived risk in product classes in the relationship between the importance of retailer attributes and patronage intentions for retailer types. Although the relationships between some of the antecedent factors of patronage intentions have been tested in previous studies, they have never been tested jointly in the context of Internet shopping. Data were collected in three stages. The first two stages were the pretest studies that were conducted to select products as examples to represent each product category. The hypotheses were tested using data collected from a nationwide survey of those who previously purchased products or services on the Internet. The results of the analyses support the hypotheses."

The first essay examines the impact of the strength of target firms' takeover defenses on acquiring firms' probability of successfully completing takeover deals, acquiring firms' takeover wealth effects, and their long-term performance. The evidence indicates that acquirers are more likely to complete takeovers if targets have weaker defenses. Additionally, acquisition announcement cumulative abnormal returns are lower for acquirers bidding on targets with stronger defenses. However, acquiring firms underperform in the long-run, which has limited relation with targets' takeover defense strengths. The second essay examines the market's reaction to announcements of the adoption of shareholder-friendly poison pills. The market's reaction is generally favorable to poison pill announcements. Cumulative abnormal returns surrounding friendly poison pill adoptions are positive and statistically significant. Additionally, adoptions of poison pills with sunset and TIDE provisions are positively and significantly related to poison pill announcement wealth effects. However, dead hand and fiduciary out provisions have significant inverse relation with poison pill announcement cumulative abnormal returns. Poison pills with chewable, no hand, and adverse persons clauses do not significantly explain cumulative abnormal returns. The cancellation study analyzes abnormal short selling interests in target firms in the month prior to the announcement of a cancelled takeover bid. Average short selling levels are 4 or 5 times higher than normal short selling levels in the month prior to the announcement of takeover bid cancellation, and are negatively related to announcement wealth effects. These initial findings imply that short sellers may be able to anticipate the negative wealth effects associated with deal failure, and hence increase short interests to benefit from target's (albeit brief) decline in value. However, further analyses point to short sellers using market-to-fundamentals strategies, and imply that increased abnormal short selling in the month prior to the announcement of cancelled takeover bids may be coincidental."

An analysis is made of the returns one might expect from each method of investment, based on data in the past decade. On the basis of this analysis, it would seem that a person would have fared about equally well in a choice between the two methods, provided that such person did at least as well in the selection of stock investments as the averages of stock market results (in terms of over-all income, including both capital gains and dividends). Although no conclusive choice would appear to be warranted, the uncertainties inherent in the purchase of term insurance and investment in stocks would appear to preclude such alternative for any person not wishing to speculate."

This dissertation examines two corporate restructuring activities, namely (i) spinoffs and (ii) mergers and acquisitions. The first essay examines whether poison pill adoptions by impending spinoff subsidiaries is consistent with goal of shareholder wealth maximization. The main implication of my findings is that poison pills do not deter takeovers; not even in environments where takeovers are more likely. Hence, poison pill adoptions may not be motivated by entrenchment. However, since managers' motives are never clear, investors react adversely to poison pill adoptions because of concerns about potential abuse of power by management. Interestingly, the evidence suggests that poison pills have a positive effect on firm value over the longterm. One possible explanation for this finding is that the potential for abuse associated with poison pills promote shareholder activism. Since activist shareholders closely monitor managers, poison pills indirectly enhance firm value. The second essay examines whether spinoff withdrawals are in response to (i) the market reaction to the initial spinoff announcement, (ii) changes in the estimated value of the unit over the spinoff interval, and (iii) changes in expected spinoff gains owing to changes in market conditions within the subsidiary's industry. It takes 7 months to complete an announced spinoff, on average, over which time industry conditions are likely to change. The main implications of my findings are that managers learn from the market and track changes in industry conditions when making spinoff decisions. It appears that managers time spinoffs for periods when the subsidiary's industry valuations are high to fetch a better price in the market for the unit. These practices are consistent with the goal of maximizing shareholders' wealth. The third essay examines whether having outside blockholders with a higher propensity to monitor managers cause variations in (i) abnormal announcement returns, (ii) proportional wealth gains, (iii) takeover premiums, and (iv) payment methods. The evidence supports the view that the types of outside blockholders that targets and bidders have, in relation to their propensity to monitor managers, affect bargaining position. Firms that have outside blockholders with higher propensities to monitor managers experience higher takeover gains because monitoring limits takeover related agency costs. Therefore, acquisitions create agency problems for minority shareholders of the target and bidder firms, when managers are not monitored."

These factors include self-efficacy, outcome expectations, personality traits, interest in computers, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and perceived IT job availability. The paper develops and tests a theoretical model based on social cognitive theory and the theory of planned behavior, and also incorporates the five factor model of personality. The intent of this study is to extend the social cognitive theory and theory of planned behavior literatures by expanding their application to IT career choice issues and by including personality traits as additional factors. The latter addition also indicates a unique application of the five factor personality model, as it is rarely used in concert with self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and broad environmental factors such as job market demands. A multi-section survey was administered to college undergraduates at four large universities in the southeastern United States. Analysis of the data results showed that college undergraduates with positive attitudes towards the IT major and high perceived behavioral control regarding the IT major had a greater intention of pursuing IT. The study also found positive links between 1) computer self-efficacy and self-evaluating outcome expectations regarding an IT career, 2) computer self-efficacy and perceived behavioral control, and 3) self-evaluating outcome expectations and attitudes towards the IT major. In addition, personality traits moderated a number of model relationships. Finally, it was found that males were significantly more likely to choose IT than females and scored higher on computer self-efficacy, self-evaluating outcome expectations, attitudes towards the IT major, interest in computers, and perceived behavioral control.

This thesis tests the stock markets in six of the largest developed economies for informational efficiency. It tests the stock markets in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, The United Kingdom, and The United States, for the existence of a causal relationship between changes in the money supply and changes in stock prices, and applies the Granger-causality test to perform it. A stock market is informationally inefficient if a causal relationship between changes in the money supply and changes in stock prices is found. In this case, money supply changes could be used to predict movements in the prices of stocks, create profitable trading rules, and help us earn above-normal returns, thus casting doubts on the ability of the stock market to allocate funds efficiently."

Since lawsuits are costly, managers should be motivated to avoid a securities fraud class action. Prior research argues that managers attempt to mitigate the adverse effects of class actions by preempting negative eamings surprises (Skinner 1994 ). However, this study argues that when a firm is overvalued, managers have incentives to avoid value reducing disclosure, which may lead to the violation of securities fraud laws. I investigate this assertion by testing associations between overvalued equity and the two outcomes of a securities fraud class action: dismissals and settlements. Other relevant factors related to overvalued equity are also tested and measured. These other factors include cases where the lead plaintiff is an institution, the length of the class period, the intrinsic value of exercisable CEO in-the-money stock option holdings, and corporate governance as measured by a corporate governance score and the occurrence of a GAAP violation. Findings show that the likelihood of a non-dismissal increases when an institution is the lead plaintiff and CEOs of overvalued firms hold higher amounts of in-the-money options. In addition, results suggest that for overvalued firms, stronger governance increases the probability of a non-dismissal."

Profit warnings present important market information as to the recent past firm performance as well as a glimpse into the firm's future prospects. By implementing Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) in October 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) attempted to change the information environment by reducing information asymmetry between analysts and the investing public. This dissertation examines the impact of Regulation (FD) as it relates to three specific areas. Essay One examines Regulation FD's impact on market reaction to profit warnings by U.S. firms and finds significant market reaction over a two-day announcement window. The analysis in this dissertation documents statistically significant changes in the extent of the market reaction in the pre- and post-Regulation FD periods. Evidence is also presented that indicates a significant reduction in information leakage (as measured by negative cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) in stock price for firms in the two-week period immediately prior to a profit warning. Essay Two focuses on American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and examines differences in comparative market reaction (ADRs versus U.S. stocks) in the pre and post-Regulation FD periods. Essay Three tests the market reaction to profit warnings for commercial bank stocks in the pre- and post-Regulation FD periods with particular attention focused on the contagion effect. The empirical analysis in this dissertation seeks to answer the question of whether the implementation of Regulation FD successfully achieves the SEC's goal of reducing information asymmetry between analysts and investors."
023731763,(OCoLC)36687524,http://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/12486,"Three models have been proposed to measure service quality in the marketing literature. These models are: (1) Perception minus Expectations (P-E) Model, (2) Ideal Point (IP) Model, and (3) Performance-based (P-based) model. Underlying the models are two types of attributes: (a) vector point attributes (in the P-E and P-based models), and (b) ideal point attributes (in the IP model). With vector point attributes, increasing performance levels produce increased levels of favorable evaluation by customers. With ideal point attributes, increased levels of performance produces favorable evaluation up to the ideal, but beyond the ideal further performance is unfavorably evaluated. This research extends the attribute typology by introducing a third type called the ""threshold point attribute."" Threshold point attributes are those where customers' evaluation are posited to be favorable when performance increases up to a threshold point. Beyond the threshold point increases in performance are not accompanied by incremental increases in favorable evaluation (as with vector attributes), nor do they turn negative (as with ideal point attributes). That is, the marginal change in evaluation (whether an increase or decrease) is zero after the threshold level. In addition to extending the attribute typology, this research also proposes an enhanced model which subsumes vector, ideal and threshold point attributes. Because of its inclusiveness, the enhanced model is hypothesized to better represent the construct of service quality than the P-E, IP, and P-based models. A survey was mailed to 4,975 customers of an internationally known service firm. Results of a piecewise regression analysis on the data show that threshold point attributes exist in services. The enhanced model, however, does not perform better than other models in criterion and construct validity tests. One significant implication for managers is that they can avoid expenditures on features that customers do not desire beyond a threshold level. The most important direction for future research is to develop and test a contingency theory of customers' attribute classifications."
027568244,(OCoLC)46815081,http://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/12644,"This dissertation examines the effect of variables specific to different industries on initial public offerings (IPOs). It has been widely accepted that IPOs perform well in the immediate aftermarket and perform poorly in the subsequent months. The uncertainty surrounding IPOs has been a frequently cited reason for the initial underpricing. The size of the offering, underwriter prestige, the number of uses of gross proceeds, and the level of inside ownership are a few of the variables that have been found to measure the uncertainty of IPOs across industries. The uncertainty of IPOs in different industries may also be affected by variables that are unique to that industry. The level of interest rates and the amount of regulation may affect the performance of existing financial service firms. The uncertainty of IPOs in the financial services industry may also be affected by these variables. This study finds that some financial service firm IPOs are affected by the level of interest rates. Some regulatory changes increase the uncertainty, and therefore the initial returns, of IPOs of financial service firms. The type of ownership structure affects the management of a firm due to differing agency costs. A mutual holding company (MHC) is a mutual company that issues a minority stake to the public. The MHC structure has been common among savings banks and is growing in popularity in the life insurance industry. The lack of takeover possibilities and stockholder control diminishes the risk taking behavior of MHCs in the thrift industry. Savings banks that choose the MHC structure experience lower initial returns without significant long run differences than savings banks that choose to convert to a completely stockholder owned bank. The operating characteristics may also affect the uncertainty of the firm. The internet allows firms to enter into an industry while having completely different operating structure than many of the other competitors. This study finds that firms that have an internet focus have higher initial returns than a matching set of IPOs. The changing environment, due to technology and low barriers to entry, increases the uncertainty of internet firms."

A related objective of the firm's management that is consistent with this prime objective should be to minimize the cost of all inputs into the firm's income producing process. This would include minimizing the cost of the capital required to fund the firm's operations. This study examines the cost of debt to firms issuing new debt. Using a sample of new debt issues between 1988 and 1993 drawn from a listing compiled by the Capital Markets Division of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, this study finds that when underwriters are categorized by recent (last year) experience, the issuing firm's choice of an underwriter does not affect the offering yield required of the issuer in excess of several benchmark yields. Excess yield is tested with respect to 3-month treasury bills, 10-year constant maturity treasury securities, the average contemporary yield on AAA rated corporate bonds, and the average contemporary yield on new corporate issues carrying the same rating. The results do suggest that the issuing firm's choice of underwriter does affect the underwriter spread that the issuer will be charged. The implication of the results to corporate issuers of new debt is that choosing an experienced underwriter (defined in the study as having appeared in the listing of the top ten underwriters of corporate debt reported by Wall Street Journal in the previous year) could lead to reduced overall net interest costs stemming from the reduced underwriter spread."

The first essay examines the long-run performance of firms emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Once a firm files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it has to file a disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court. The statement details the company's current state of affairs and the factors that led to bankruptcy. The company also files a plan of reorganization. The plan details the company's debts and how the company plans to restructure and pay the debts. While operating under Chapter 11, the company makes regular disclosures of operating data to the court. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the company adopts fresh start reporting whereby its assets are reported at their net realizable values. Hence, the bankruptcy process provides the market with information that is useful in assessing the potential of the finn that is emerging from bankruptcy. As a result, post-bankruptcy, the performance of the firm should match expectation. Indeed, the evidence suggests that there is pricing efficiency after firms emerge from Chapter II bankruptcy and that they seem to perform properly when size, structure and risk are taken into account. The second essay examines the pricing of equity offerings by firms that emerged from Chapter II bankruptcy. In contrast to original IPOs, which are completely new to the market, post-bankruptcy equity offerings are performed by firms that were once publicly traded. Furthermore, while they are operating under Chapter II, the bankruptcy process provides information relevant in assessing the value of the firms upon their emergence from bankruptcy. Hence, there exists less information asymmetry in equity offerings by firms that emerged from bankruptcy compared to original IPOs. The reduced information asymmetry implies that the level of mispricing, if any, should be less in post-bankruptcy equity offerings than in original IPOs. Indeed, the results suggest that post-bankruptcy equity offerings are less underpriced than original IPOs and they are not subject to a reversal in returns in the long-run. The third essay examines the wealth effects of acquisitions of bankrupt assets to the acquiror's shareholders. Bankruptcy can lead to underpriced assets, lower costs of acquiring them and concessions from creditors of the bankrupt firm. These factors increase the net worth of acquiring bankrupt assets. Indeed, the results suggest that firms announcing acquisitions of bankrupt assets experience favorable wealth effects."

Internet-based advertising is neither given the focus on information and the ability to narrowly target such appeals (sites), as in direct marketing advertising. Given the emergence of Internet promotions, this is a substantial gap in our knowledge. This research seeks to both extend the boundaries of current direct marketing research (with its predominant focus on who will reply) and the domain of existing persuasion theories and models, attempting to gain a greater understanding of why consumers respond as they do to Internet advertising. By adapting the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to the Internet, this research attempts to determine if executional cues play a role in enhancing persuasiveness and the moderating effects of involvement. Additionally, this research draws on the substantial work on attitude towards the ad (A$\sb{\rm ad}$), including attempts to greater understand the antecedents of these attitudes and proposed distinctions between executional and content aspects of Internet ads, to see if this rich framework is useful in predicating outcomes for Internet advertising. This research has significant implications for practitioners as it looks beyond atheoretical testing-based insights of what people respond to, drawing on established theory to provide insights into why consumers respond as they do to Internet based advertising. Testing the adaptability of current persuasion theory to this emerging medium will do much to begin building a solid understanding of how Internet advertising works. Using an interactive computer-based simulation in a 2 (involvement) x 2 (argument strength) x 2 (peripheral cue: present or absent) between subject factorial design with 224 subjects the adaptability of existing persuasion research to the Internet was tested. Findings demonstrate the adaptability of the ELM to Internet advertising, as well as the important antecedent effects of attitudes towards Internet advertising on persuasion. However, the decomposition of A$\sb{\rm ad}$ proved less useful in this new domain. All told, much of what we currently know about persuasion is likely to prove useful in developing promotional campaigns for the Internet."

One group of scholars recommends standardized global marketing strategies based on the premise that technological advances in telecommunication, transportation, and media are leading to similarities in customer preferences across the world. Other researchers recommend multi-domestic strategies on the premise that consumer heterogeneity continues to increase even within countries. Firms marketing products in global markets appear to adopt global marketing strategies, multi-domestic strategies, and various intermediate strategies that encompass different degrees of standardization. This research develops a theoretical framework to examine the factors that influence marketing strategies in global markets. Transaction cost analysis constructs are used to determine whether to standardize or customize marketing strategy. The basis for adopting different levels of standardization on marketing program and process variables is empirically investigated. A multinomial logit model is used to estimate the likelihood of adopting different degrees of standardization with data from American multinational corporations on 161 products marketed in different global markets. The results indicate that higher levels of asset specificity associated with patented technical knowledge favor physical attribute standardization in global markets. Volatile political environments, high degrees of ownership in affiliates, and global competitors' standardized marketing strategies encourage firms to tailor physical attributes. Brand names are standardized if the economic uncertainty is lower in foreign markets. Cultural dissimilarities between home and host countries hinder marketing control systems standardization. Operating experience in foreign countries and the need for technical service and customer interactions support standardization of marketing control systems. The need for specialized local market knowledge encourages the adoption of country-specific marketing research methods. Standardized pricing strategies are preferred over flexible country-specific strategies in volatile political environments."

My first essay analyzes the performance of sector funds across different stages of business cycles. Using a sample of 1,488 sector funds over the period 1990 to 2005, I demonstrate that sector funds perform differently across different stages in the business cycles. Average difference between expansion and recession cycles ranges from 2.75 percent per year to 3.78 percent per year. Findings of this essay further suggest that sector funds do exhibit different timing effects across recessions and expansions. Flow of funds and buy turnover ratio have differential effects across business cycles whereas sell turnover trading activities have a negative effect on funds' overall performance. My second essay analyzes the performance of ""focus funds"". These funds are well managed but tend to keep 50 or less stocks in their portfolio. Using a sample of 926 focus funds that existed during all or part of the period 1997 to 2006, I find that on average focus funds do not outperform a corresponding passive benchmark. My results further indicate that focus funds that are more concentrated in their top holdings, have larger net asset size, relatively young management and lower turnover ratios may offer higher abnormal returns compared to passive benchmarks. The third essay analyzes the effect of taxes and tax overhang on the flow of funds and performance in bond funds. Using a sample of 741 corporate bond funds that existed at some time during the period 1997 to 2006, findings of this essay indicate that new investors to bond funds are sensitive to unrealized capital gains/losses, however, the flow of funds is not affected by past dividend distributions. Findings further indicate that tax liabilities, unrealized gains/losses, and managerial tenure explain post-tax abnormal performance after controlling for investment style, and other known factors that explain the pre-tax performance ofbond funds."

The study reports that the announcements are associated with significantly positive abnormal returns (0.48 percent). The returns are more pronounced when the new CIO is hired from an IT leader firm (1.94 percent). Abnormal returns are significantly positive related with the CIO's level of education and high-technology firms, and negatively related with firm size. In addition, there is no significant difference in market reaction between the announcements that publicize the creation of a new position and those that imply the filling of an existing position with new hires. Further, the study finds an association between the appointment of the new CIO and subsequent improvement in the accounting measures of profitability.

Since stock prices in an efficient market reflect all of the available information instantaneously, investors cannot profit by analyzing macroeconomic indicators. Thus, the implication is that there are no immediate profit-making opportunities in efficient markets and there are profit-making opportunities in less efficient markets. If the stock market ofthe United States is proven to be efficient, then the news media is incorrect in its presentation of macroeconomic data in order to predict an adjustment in the stock market."
024047564,(OCoLC)41556775,http://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/12508,"The purpose of this study is to empirically test a number of hypotheses related to unit initial public offerings. Specifically, the following areas are examined: (1) the underpricing unit IPOs relative to a subset of NASDAQ straight-equity IPOs; (2) the impact of the size and value of the overallotment option on the degree of underpricing and the underwriter percentage spread; (3) the impact of the size and value of the underwriter warrants on the degree of underpricing and the underwriter; (4) certification effects of auditor type and bank and bridge loans; (5) the distribution function of the underwriter; (6) the levels of financing packaged in the unit as a signal of firm quality, as well as, factors affecting the probability of packaging multiple levels of financing; (7) factors influencing the probability that the units offered will be detached into their component securities and (8) factors influencing unit bid-ask spreads. In general, the results indicate that unit IPOs are more underpriced than a similar subset of NASDAQ straight-equity IPOs. The excessive underpricing is reflective of the high degree of uncertainty surrounding these offerings. Also, the findings indicate that the degree of underpricing associated with unit offerings is influenced by the size of the offering, higher prestige unit underwriters and lower aftermarket volatility. Additionally, the value and size of the explicit options (the overallotment option and the underwriter warrants) granted in these offerings do not significantly impact the degree of unit underpricing. Furthermore, the evidence indicates the existence of certification benefits for those unit firms using big six/eight auditors and bank loans. In addition, the results imply that the underpricing of unit issues increases as the distribution effort of the underwriter decreases. Also, those unit firms packaging two levels of financing at the IPO (A and B warrants) seem to have a greater degree of uncertainty in comparison to those firms packaging only a single level of financing (A warrants only). For these firms, the probability of packaging multiple levels of financing is higher if the firm is underwritten on a best efforts basis and insiders retain a larger percentage of voting control. Similarly, the probability of a unit offering being detached into its component securities is greater with higher expected market making costs and a greater perception of firm value by the marketplace. Lastly, adverse information risk is greatest for the warrant component of detachable units. Furthermore, the findings indicate that underwriter stabilization and flipping seem to be infrequent events for the unit component."

This study examines underpricing, short- and long-run performance of one special class of such low-priced stocks. I examine IPOs filed for and issued as Penny Stocks, as defined by the amended SEC Act of 1990. The study finds average first-day excess returns of 128% over a benchmark NASDAQ Decile 1 Index. The excess returns on nonpenny IPOs issued on the same markets as the penny stocks are 7.6% over the S&P 500 Index. Cross-sectional analyses show that lower-priced penny stocks and stocks of smaller firms are more highly underpriced. Consistent with the information asymmetry hypothesis, penny stocks that were issued on the pink sheets are more highly underpriced than those on the more exposed and more regulated environments of the NASDAQ Small Capitalization markets and the OTC markets. The short- and long-run performance analyses show that, in general, penny stocks have a high performance of between 18% to 20% raw returns in the first year of issue but that declines sharply after a 13-month period. I find an 11-month optimal holding period over which an investor could maximize his returns in a portfolio of penny stocks. I further show that a passive buy-and-hold investment in penny stocks held longer than this optimal period can be a poor investment but an actively-managed penny-stock portfolio can outperform comparable benchmark portfolios of various market indexes on both raw and risk-adjusted basis. Penny stock issuers have shifted from public issues to private placement since 2001. I examine the return to investors in these private issues during the lockup period or until those issues eventually end up in the public domain. The average annualized return to investors during the lockup period is 229%, with only 5% of those issues recording negative returns. Investors who bought these stocks immediately after the lockup period, however, experience an 11% drop in value but the trend reversed after about 10 months, indicating a better long-run performance than those initially issued on the public markets. I examine the effect of the Penny Stock Reform Act (1990) on the number of sanctions that were imposed on the penny stock issuers. The policy intervention analysis shows that the number of sanctions dropped by 9% in the immediate aftermath of the enactment of the Act but increased significantly by nearly 4.7% per quarter thereafter."

This concept has a number of applications in finance like calculating the change in the price of bonds due to the change in interest rates, immunizing the value of bonds, etc. Common stocks are also financial obligations and are considered to have durations. For bonds and similar strong contractual obligations, duration and its applications are clear cut and are used widely. For common stocks duration evaluation is difficult and its practical applications hardly exist. Moreover, there are no publications of numerical results where duration was applied to common stocks. These facts make it doubtful whether duration can be applied to common stocks. The results of the empirical research here, with numerical results, make it doubtful that duration can be applied to common stocks or to explain price fluctuations of common stocks."
026459168,(OCoLC)42664834,http://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/12596,"This dissertation extends previous research on the exchange-rate exposure of multinational corporations. Exchange rate exposure is defined as the impact of unanticipated changes in exchange rates on stock prices. The motivation for the study lies in a fundamental discrepancy between academic research and practice: Academic research has shown that exchange-rate exposure is not priced in capital markets, but the use of financial hedging instruments designed to protect firms from unanticipated changes in exchange rates is widespread. This leads to the conclusion that exchange rate exposure is priced in equity markets and is a function of firm specific factors. This dissertation segregated firms based on various factors that might affect its exchange rate exposure. They are: A firms foreign sales characteristics, the export/import characteristics of the industry to which it belongs, the competitive structure of the firms industry, its business organization and its degree of concentration in sales. The results indicate that firms that operate in the service sector of the economy are more exposed to exchange rate risk than those that operate in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, the degree of competition among firms in an industry does not have an impact on exchange rate exposure. The results indicate that a firms degree of concentration in foreign sales has an impact on its exchange rate exposure. These results imply that restructuring operations can reduce a firms exchange rate risk. When taken together, the results of the dissertation indicate that exchange rate is exposure is priced in capital markets and is a function of firm specific factors. These results have implications for corporate investors and managers. Corporate investors can choose portfolios that will limit their exchange rate exposure. Corporate managers can make hedging decisions for the firm based on the degree of exposure the firm faces which is a function of who it is and what it does."

025865752,(OCoLC)41509988,http://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/12564,"This study documents the nature of the underlying information that caused investor overreaction and under-reaction. While research has documented the existence of market overreaction and under-reaction, it has not comprehensively addressed the underlying information releases that caused the extreme price fluctuations. This study controls for the underlying announcements, and finds that the degrees of overreaction and under-reaction vary according to the underlying information releases. A primary contribution of this dissertation is the finding that undefined events are associated with higher degrees of overreaction than defined events. The Wall Street Journal Index was used to determine if each event had an announcement that coincided with it. Defined events are those for which an underlying announcement was found in the Wall Street Journal Index. For undefined events, no announcement was found. This finding supports the theory of investor overconfidence and biased self-attribution by Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998). This study analyzes the overreaction and under-reaction phenomenon in three areas: international securities, domestic securities, and foreign currency. The international securities analyzed are American depository receipts and international closed-end funds. The domestic securities analyzed are financial and non-financial stocks. In the foreign currency area, currencies are classified into two types: emerging country currencies and industrial country currencies. In all of these areas, controlling for the underlying announcements is beneficial in understanding market overreaction and under-reaction. Finally, cross-sectional regression equations are employed to relate post-event returns or exchange rate changes to different variables, such as initial price change, pre-event information leakage, size (market value), month of the year (December or January), day of the week, and announcement type. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests larger initial price movements and prevent information leakage are associated with higher degrees of overreaction, and that the tendency towards overreaction is stronger for undefined events."

The first was the information search and analysis these entrepreneurs performed when they made certain basic decisions necessary to start most business prior to commencement of operations. The second was the ongoing information search activities of entrepreneurs who had started childcare businesses and were managing them in their first few years of operation. In addition, this dissertation assessed the extent these scanning activities were consistent with a dual process theory of reasoning. Finally, the limitations of the study and suggested future research directions for research of entrepreneurial scanning were discussed. The results suggest an entrepreneur's scanning behavior at the start of the business may be different from scanning behavior that occurs once the business has been operating for a period of time. The need for cognition, exposure to statistical thinking and intelligence (operationalized in this study as the amount of formal education) were positively related to the kind of information search and analysis undertaken by the entrepreneur at the startup of the business that Kahneman (2003) and others describe as System 2 reasoning. The accessibility of information and the amount of formal education were positively related to scanning that was done in periods subsequent to startup by these childcare entrepreneurs. Work-family conflict was negatively related to scanning during this period."

Five research hypotheses were developed drawing from the ""social value"" component of the Theory of Consumption Values of Sheth, J. N., B. I. Newman, and B. L. Gross. (1991. Consumption Values and Market Choices: Theory and Applications, Cincinnati, Ohio: South-Western Publishing Co.). An experiment was conducted with the language manipulation through a national mail survey. None of the following hypotheses were supported. (1) Hispanics will have a more positive attitude toward products advertised with the English language than to those advertised with the Spanish language. (2) Hispanics will have a more positive attitude toward socially visible products advertised with the English language than to those advertised with the Spanish language. (3) Hispanics will have a more positive attitude toward luxury products advertised with the English language than to those advertised with the Spanish language. (4) Lower socio-economic status Hispanics will have a more positive attitude toward products advertised with the English language than with the Spanish language. (5) Less acculturated Hispanics will have a more positive attitude toward products advertised with the English language than with the Spanish language. Overall, the results show that under a variety of conditions neither language clearly outperforms the other when dealing with printed advertisements directed to US Hispanics. Lower status and less acculturated Hispanics showed slightly more favorable attitude (than higher status and acculturated Hispanics) toward advertisements of any product regardless of the language used in the advertisement. Hispanics of any social class or acculturation level showed slightly more favorable attitudes toward products advertised in Spanish language regardless of whether the product is luxury, non-luxury, visible, or not visible. The main practical implication of the findings is that it might not be cost-effective or necessary to create a Spanish language printed promotional campaign in addition to an original English one to reach most US Hispanics. However, in the relatively less frequent situation where a substantial desirable segment of Hispanics is not exposed to the English media, it might be advantageous to use Spanish media with advertisements created in Spanish language."

In such organizations, one of the major problems is to keep the activities and policies of the association open to scrutiny by an input from the members. Two forces work against the easy solution of this problem: membership apathy and the development of rule by oligarchy. This thesis focuses on the functions and structures of trade and professional associations; on the characteristics of their members and leaders; and on the question of rule by oligarchy. The many functions performed by these associations, along with the complex structural constraints under which they operate are shown to have an affect upon their management. Member attitudes are explored and trends on critical issues compared over a six year period. The nature and role of association leaders are examined.

It develops a DRP theory, as an extension of dividend and capital structure theories. Furthermore, the study tests empirically several hypotheses related to the market reaction at the announcement of a DRP adoption, to the market reaction at the announcement of a DRP discontinuance and to the performance of the company sponsoring a DRP. The results indicated that the market reaction to the announcement of a DRP establishment is favorable on days 1 and 2, significant only for the latter. In the long-run, DRPs create value for the sponsoring firm and its shareholders (as measured by Tobin's Q). The announcement of a DRP termination is followed by a negative market reaction, consistent with the thesis of this study. Finally, several factors such as the DRP type (Type I and Type II plans), the industry of the sponsoring company (utilities and non-utilities), tax legislation, the discount feature and the dividend payout ratio are examined in relation to the market reaction at the announcement of a DRP adoption. The Type II DRPs create more favorable reaction to Type I plans at the announcement of their introduction. There are significant differences between the market reaction at the DRP introduction of utilities and non-utilities. The tax legislation affects corporate dividend policy and DRPs. Finally, the discount feature is not regarded favorably by investors as it was hypothesized, which explains its elimination from many DRPs in the recent years."

A multiplicity of influences plays upon any determination of wages for the individual and the organization. These forces vary so in their impact that any static approach to wage criteria is misleading. The executive employee's compensation must contain both financial and non-financial elements designed to supply the urge, stimulus, and encouragement to improve profit performance and enhance the growth, expansion, and progress of the company. Since each form of compensation has both advantages and disadvantages they must be carefully weighed if they are to meet the short-term and long-term objectives of both the company and the employee."

All too frequently such projects are inappropriate, are in conflict with already established programs, and perhaps if developed may well pose a burden on a given community's resources despite the commendable motives of the voluntary organization. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a simplified model procedure by which a given community can be surveyed as to the appropriateness of a given project as well as to judge the potential for financial viability. The procedure will be in keeping with the known precepts of effective community social and health planning."

The studies apply techniques of the unit root, cointegration and Standard Granger causality tests to examine the relationship between these two financial variables. The empirical results reveal that there is no causal linkage and no cointegration between the stock prices and exchange rates as suggested under Traditional and Portfolio approaches. The results support the view that the semi-strong form of EMH holds true for the U.S. financial markets."

027553503,(OCoLC)46781884,http://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/12643,"This dissertation extends previous research on bubbles by investigating whether changes in the financial asset prices of the S&P500 reflect changes in fundamentals. We propose that if this is not the case the volatility is due to a bubble. Hence, this is the general hypothesis from which several testable hypotheses are developed. A key issue in bubble research is the definition of fundamentals. In this work we assume that, in the long-run, operating revenues are the only source from which any payments can be made, including dividend payments. Therefore, if expectations are formulated correctly, on average, there has to be a relationship between changes in prices and changes in corporate revenues. Thus, we use different accounting variables as proxies for fundamentals. In addition, since the literature points to contagion of opinion as one of the causes for the creation of bubbles, we also examine the contemporaneous relationship between prices and several proxies for herding behavior. OLS, panel data analysis, and quantile regression are used to analyze the contemporaneous relationship between prices and fundamentals or contagion proxies; while cointegration (reconciled to be used with panel data) and the Bonferroni inequality are used to investigate the long-run equilibrium between prices and fundamentals. The results indicate that, overall, company earnings are not explanatory of prices. These findings hold both in the short-run and in the long-run equilibrium scenarios. In addition, we find that investors do not reward an increase of the debt in the capital structure of corporations. In reference to our contagion variables, changes in money flow, volume, and volatility are found explanatory of changes in prices. Nevertheless, the effect of these variables is not homogeneous across price changes. Specifically, Money Flow is significant across all quantiles except for the 30% lowest price changes, Volume is explanatory of the 35% highest price changes, while volatility is explanatory across all the distribution of price changes. An interesting observation is that the three independent variables become increasingly explanatory as we move up to higher quantiles. Taken together our findings are supportive of the bubble and contagion hypotheses."

The problem area was whether the fundamental concepts of management by objectives as applied to the system used by the organization accomplished the measurement and correction of the performance of staff through a system of control. Secondary research concentrated on common practice and theory of the function of control and the system of management by objectives. Current manuals and instructions on Objectives and Goals issued by the American Red Cross were used for comparison. It was found that this system has the basic format of management by objectives but, as practiced, does not appear to function as a process of control."

Private capital flows into these regions surged to unprecedented heights. Present paper gives an overview of what gave rise to this sudden come-back of external finance to the developing world, why its composition and geographical dispersion had changed, and how it affected the macroeconomic environment of the recipient nation. Furthermore, a cross-section econometric analysis is applied to thirty-four countries for the early 1990s, to determine the effect of private inflows on the growth rate of real GDP, as a proxy for economic development, in the context of a standard neoclassical growth equation framework. Results confirm the favorable impact of portfolio investment, but foreign direct investment appears to hinder economic growth. An attempt is made to interpret these results and compare them with existing empirical research."

From what was learned in this review of PPBS, the characteristics and practices of PPBS seem most appropriate to the management needs of the American Rental Association, Inc., and it could be an effective management tool in other associations. This was shown by abstracting the key features from the system developed for the American Rental Association, Inc., and examining their applicability in other selected associations.

Human capital is assumed to be the basis of such growth, therefore, the focus is not on technological change per se. Through empirical analysis, human capital is measured by knowledge, and that the accumulation of knowledge, or specialization, is determined through an incentive system. The incentive system, in turn, is determined by the difference in wages paid to certain types of knowledge, those being a general level and a specialized level of knowledge. It is assumed that the learning process can take place at any time, therefore, the specialization process is not limited to an academic environment. A spillover effect associated with specialized knowledge provides for increasing returns to scale in the model, which is also supported by empirical data."

The relations of the US stock market and other five major stock markets, i.e., the Canadian, French, German, Japanese, and UK markets are investigated. The time series used in this study are monthly stock price and dividend indices for the above six stock markets. The data cover the period from January 1970 to March 1991. In this study I utilize the ARCH model which appears to be very powerful in modeling conditional heteroscedasticity of stock prices. My test results provide unambiguous evidence of significant ARCH effects existing between the six national stock markets. Therefore, this study demonstrates the existence of market inefficiency for these national markets."

Ifthis is true, when studying organizations perhaps more effort should be given to examining the effects of the structure of social relations within the firm . This study has attempted to take the first steps in beginning to systematically study identifiable and predictable effects of the informal structure of relations on the behavior of individuals. During the process of examining the etfects of epistemic motives and individual social structure on the actions of individuals, two important questions were addressed. First, what are the effects of epistemic motives on the formation of individual social structure? The findings of this study suggest that the need for closure and the need for cognition affect the formation of individual social structure in different and identifiable ways. In addition, the level of epistemic motivation atiects the degree to which social interactions affect tie strength. The second question is what are the effects of individual social structures on individual actions? The findings of this study suggest that the tie strength of an individual's social structure appears to affect interdependent actions; but, tie strength does not affect independent actions. In addition, an understanding about individuals' inclinations to take interdependent or independent actions is enhanced when the effects of both epistemic motives and social structure are considered. The findings of this study suggest that information about the epistemic motives of employees can provide insight into the fonnation of the individual social structures and the intrinsic desire of employees to take interdependent or independent actions. The effects of epistemic motives and individual social structure on individual actions, the organizing process and the formulation and implementation of strategies are discussed."
