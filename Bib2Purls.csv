Teenagers, many of whom are already of lower socioeconomic status, are at risk for preterm birth and low birth weight, as well as incomplete use of available services. This inquiry used a retrospective comparative research design to evaluate the effectiveness of Project Teen in Palm Beach County, Florida. Project Teen is a multidisciplinary program offering a continuum of support services to pregnant adolescents and newly parenting adolescents and their infants until the infants are 2 years old. Through frequent contacts, home visitation, resource referral, counseling, and education the health care professionals collaborate with the clients to facilitate clients' choices which will maximize families' health potential. Home visitation by care coordinators and senior community health nurses was positively related to pregnancy, family health, and family socioeconomic outcomes."

The purpose of this research was to explore and define what constitutes a successful collaborative practice. Open-ended, interactive interviews were conducted with three dyads of physician - nurse practitioner in the ambulatory care setting. Data analysis using the grounded theory method revealed six key elements associated with effective collaborative practice: Communication, competence, autonomy, coordination, trust and personality. This research contributes to clarification of the barriers that hinder a collaborative practice and suggests many benefits derived from such a practice. The findings of the study may inspire other health care providers to enter a collaborative practice to achieve excellence in patient care.

This study used Leininger's theory, Culture Care Diversity and Universality, and ethnonursing method to discover Mayan folk care practices and their relationship to professional care. Sixteen universal and four diverse themes were discovered. The struggle to preserve cultural identity while finding ways to be part of a new culture was an important theme. The use of healers, herbal medicines, rituals and unregulated injections were accepted practices within the community. Professional health care along with folk care practices were often used simultaneously. The processes of acculturation, enculturation, and marginalization influence caring modalities as well as contribute to the Guatemalan Mayan contribution to the South Florida Cultural Mosaic."

This methodology evolved from the human becoming theory of nursing which includes an existential view of person and the nursing simultaneity paradigmatic view of man and health. The entity for study in this research was the lived experience of making a difficult decision. Parse's methodology was used and includes: participant selection, dialogical engagement, extraction-synthesis and heuristic interpretation. The structure of the experience of making a difficult decision was discovered through the experiences of four participants. This is expressed as living with feelings of self doubt that give way to assurance while searching within and reaching out to others until affirming the circumstances of the chaos generates possibilities and enables perseverance. This study demonstrates Parse's research methodology and broadens nursing's knowledge base."

Retrospective data were analyzed after a period of eight months of data collection. These data included a pre-test/post-test which was given to emergency room nursing staff in southeast Florida. Inservice education was given by an organ procurement coordinator during an eight month period. The number of referrals were analyzed at the beginning and end of this period. There was a positive correlation between the increased knowledge of the emergency room nursing staff and the increase in referral rates. This information gives support to the significance of the organ procurement coordinator's role as educator to emergency room nurses. By increasing knowledge regarding the organ donation process, referral rates were increased, providing more opportunity for potential organ donors. This information can be useful for future programs to increase referral rates made by emergency room nurses. Further implications for practice, education, and research are discussed."

These were interwoven against the lifeworld existentials of relationality, spatiality, temporality, and corporeality. The findings revealed that the RNFA offers uniqueness as nursing and uniqueness as experience."

Data sources included interviews with three registered nurses and three unlicensed assistive workers practicing in partnership on an acute patient care unit. Study findings supported role theory assertions that role strain and stress, manifested as role ambiguity, role confusion, role overlapping, and role overload occur when the role transition process and role expectations are not clarified or nurtured among role partners. Implications for nursing practice include the following: (1) Nurses in clinical and administrative practice need to be sensitized to the importance of nurses and ancillary personnel being active participants in the work redesign process, and must support the value of caring that transpires in the nurse-patient relationship. (2) Role theory can be utilized to understand dynamics that occur in work settings of nurses and assistive partners."

Nurse preceptors provide a reality based experience for the student caring for patients. Yet, little is known about what is important to the preceptor in this role. The purpose of this study was to generate a new model of nursing practice education reflecting the voice of the participants in the research. Using participatory action research methods, the emergent model focused on preceptors as the critical link to student practice education in their first year of a baccalaureate nursing program and answered the question, ""What is the process of developing a preceptor led clinical practice experience for undergraduate nursing students through participatory action research?"" The study was conducted at a hospital in south Florida where students received the majority of their practice experiences. Semi-structured interviews with 15 participants, program notes, and various data sources were analyzed consistent with grounded theory analysis. Grounded in this data is the emergent Theory of Empowering Preceptors, which accounts for the process through which preceptors formulated the practice model. The contributors to the development of this model of nursing practice education identified three key categories that empowered them to assume their role. The context in which nurse preceptors were educated helped them relate to students and to understand student concerns. Creating a 'comfortable' learning experience for the student occurred next, as the preceptor sought to create environments where learning was viewed as a process. Finally, the opportunity to shape student practice experience was where preceptors used their specialized knowledge in a variety of methods without faculty constraints.

This group of 10 nursing leaders had participated in a caring for self project and had experience in nursing ranging from 18 to 32 years. One year after taking part in the caring for self project the 10 nursing leaders participated in individual taped interviews to explore the meaning of caring for self. Hermeneutic phenomenology (van Manen, 1990) was the method used for the interpretation of this research study. The depth of the lived experience of caring for self was described by each nursing leader. A metaphor of climbing a mountain to the peak of wisdom, being on the path and staying on the path regarding care of self, came from the words of the participants. In their words, the leaders communicate four common themes: Reflections on the Journey, Why Care for Self on the Journey, How to Care for Self on the Journey, and the Wisdom Learned Along the Path. Based on their reflections, recommendations include implementing creative ways to encourage care of self are for the hospital environment and educational methods to reinforce care of self for nurse leaders in the educational curriculum. A focus on care of self described by the leaders in this study may improve personal health, add to personal growth, assist in communication skills, allow for role modeling care of self to others, support setting priorities and boundaries, contribute to flexibility, and promote a work-life balance. These qualities would assist in creating a positive work environment and may influence the retention of nurses and contribute to recruiting new nursing leaders.

Using Caring Inquiry, a phenomenological-hermeneutic methodology having caring at its center, this study explores the meaning of health and widowhood to 14 older Hindu widows living in urban South India. Shifting attitudes toward widowhood reflect the rapid changes occurring in India as demonstrated by six metathemes (Drawing From Within, Seeking Help and Guidance, Accepting the Role, Challenging Tradition, Serving Others, Finding Companionship) that emerged from study data. The common need to move on with life, articulated by one widow as the ""The Show Must Go On,"" became the foundation for a theory and model of the Meaning of Health and Widowhood for Older Indian Widows. Providing an opportunity for the voices of older Indian widows to be heard through poetic expression and theme identification, research findings are further illuminated by employing Ray's Transcultural Caring in Nursing and Health Care Model linking caring, the central focus of nursing, with Indian culture, ethical principles and religious beliefs. This research's purpose is to advance the body of knowledge relating to older Indian widows' lives and begin an open dialogue about their health experiences and needs. Although Indian widows have been the subject of numerous studies, this is the first to specifically focus on their health. Study recommendations include implementing health promotion strategies for the prevention and management of chronic disease including accurate, low-cost, culturally appropriate health education information, widow-to-widow support groups to help widows with the day-to-day issues they face and meet women with common experiences and establishing networks that provide widows with opportunities to assist others less fortunate.

Adherence to the behavioral change component of the hemodialysis regimen is difficult for many reasons; when individuals fail to adhere, the nurses often become frustrated and individuals may be labeled nonadherent leading to inappropriate interventions. As the number of older adults starting hemodialysis increases, one contributing factor to nonadherence in this population may be cognitive impairment. Objective. The overall purpose of the study was to explore differences in global cognition, in self-report cognition, and in language ability relative to adherence in a sample of older adults undergoing hemodialysis. Methods. This pilot study examined the differences in cognition and adherence of older adults (?ыб60 years) undergoing out-patient hemodialysis three times a week for at least one year. Nonprobability purposive sampling was used to obtain a sample from multiple centers which offered a diverse sample of study participants (n=63). Stories of the challenges of making life style changes were audiotaped and analyzed with linguistic analysis and word count (LIWC) software and various standardized instruments that measure global cognition (3MS and MMSE), self-report cognition (KDQOL-CF) and language ability (COWA, subsets of BDAE Reading: Sentence and Paragraph and BDAE Complex Ideation) were administered during hemodialysis. Determination of adherence or nonadherence (based on literature) was completed as the last activity of data collection. Results. Statistical significance was not achieved when exploring the difference of global cognition, self-report cognition, and language ability relative to adherence (p > .05). A relationship between structural elements of big words, cognitive process and insight words used in story and measures of adherence was revealed (p < .05). Although statistical significance was not reached the descriptive data supports that a relationship between cognitive impairment and measures of adherence were present across groups. The majority (64%) of nonadherent participants had cognitive impairment; 34% of the middle group and 5% of the adherent group had cognitive impairment. Discussion. Cognitive impairment is prevalent among older adults undergoing hemodialysis, however a relationship between cognitive impairment and adherence was not revealed in this study. This may be the result of the small sample size and adherence markers that were not sensitive in this population. This preliminary work offered a descriptive foundation which generated more questions that may be answered with further research."

The individual items for both tests were evaluated for their level of difficulty and the scores on the Miami Naming Test were compared to the Boston Naming Test and the Mini Mental State Exam results. Results indicated acceptable levels of reliability for both the Boston Naming Test and the Miami Naming Test. This study shed light on which items should be replaced or deleted and future directions for research on assessment of dementia on older adults of Afro-Caribbean background. This study was supported by Minority Supplement grant #NR07744-01 and was guided by design of the parent grant Culture Bias in Expressive Ability in Dementia funded by the National Institute of Nursing research."

The purpose of this research was to explore the perceptions and experiences of women in recovery from chemical dependence and their return to the community. Leininger's ethnonursing method was used to obtain a holistic transcultural view of the beliefs, values and lifeways of twelve women in recovery. A communal moral focus was used to understand patterns of meaning, values, virtues and principles using Ray's Transcultural Nursing Ethics. Critical Social Theory was used as an overarching framework to critically analyze the lifeworld (community life of women in recovery) and the system (sociopolitical structures) to enhance the community nurse's knowledge about the needs of women to facilitate their return to community. Four themes included the following: understanding the lifeworld of chemical dependence was a symbol for facilitating the recovery process, restoring a sense of well being contributed to the meaning of a successful recovery, resituating in the community was demonstrated by actions of recreating new lifeways, and sustaining recovery by relying on the community as a source for supporting new lifeways. A critical analysis of the themes revealed paradoxical experiences of women in the dominant culture community. A synthesis of the findings from the lifeworld and analysis of the themes resulted in the co-creation of The Clarity-Parity Community Nursing Practice Framework. The framework demonstrates how the moral caring actions of the community nurse and the mutual moral caring actions of the community nurse, women in recovery and dominant culture community can result in increasing the clarity of transcultural communication and encouraging a position of parity for women in recovery within the dominant culture community."

The goals of Healthy People 2010 call for action to combat childhood obesity. A mother's recognition that her child is at risk is the first step in assisting a mother to move to action. To date the majority of research monies and effort concentrate on interventions after obesity exists. The literature supports a need to facilitate mothers in identifying their four-year-old child's body shape as an initial point of concentration. The Lester Body Shape Models (LBSM) are one method proposed to assist mothers across ethnicities and cultures to accurately identify her four-year-old child's body shape utilizing comparison as a tool. Although in this study, there was no statistical significance in the mothers' ability to identify the child's weight status or body shape (X 2 = .250, p = .617) using the CDC graphs and the LBSM as tools. However, the LBSM may be an alternative method to mothers' accurately identifying their child's body shape and weight status. Descriptors from the mothers' comments and the mothers' positive response to the visualization and comparison method using age specific models may be another technique to educate mothers' to the health related risks of childhood obesity."

Retention of nurses is a priority in health care, so a better understanding of factors that contribute to job satisfaction and intent to leave is needed. One possible factor is the quality of the interpersonal relationships that occur among managers, peers, and nurses. A negative quality would be acts of hostility or horizontal violence, which is nurse-to-nurse aggression. This is theorized to be a result of oppressed group behavior. These behaviors may influence job satisfaction and the intent to stay on the job and in the profession. The overall purpose of the study was to explore relationships between horizontal violence, oppressed group behavior, job satisfaction and intent to leave a position or nursing in the next 12 months. This pilot study examined factors that influence registered nurses ' job satisfaction and intent to leave a position or nursing. Convenience sampling was used to obtain the sample of registered nurses from a BSN completion program and a Novice Nurse Initiative Program (n=99). Written stories of conflict between nurses were obtained and analyzed with linguistic analysis and word count (LIWC) software and various standardized instruments were used including the Nurses Workplace Behavior Scale (NWBS), the Organizational Climate for Caring Scale (OCCS), the Peer Group Caring Interaction Scale (PGCIS), The McCloskey/Mueller Satisfaction Scale (MMSS) and two visual analogue scales (VAS). Significant relationships were found between job satisfaction and intent to stay in a position and nursing (p<.01), oppressed group behavior and intent to stay in nursing (p<.01), oppressed group behavior and job satisfaction (p<.01). Manager and peer caring behaviors were related to intent to stay in a position and nursing (p<.01). Using stepwise multiple regression, both manager and peer caring behaviors were found to influence the relationship between job satisfaction and intent to stay in a position or nursing. The findings of this study suggest that the quality of interpersonal relationships between managers, peers and nurses can influence job satisfaction and intent to stay in a position or nursing."

Specifically this work will compare medical and nursing interventions to those of the alternative medicine and lay or popular medicine practices. Grounded in historicism, the study produces a documentary effect allowing the reader to empathize with the healers of the past. The social context of the specific time frame was integrated into the study illuminating the Jacksonian and Progressive eras. In addition, the birth of professional nursing as we know it rose alongside allopathic medicine. This research is relevant to nursing history because it provides context for the work of nursing. Medicine used advancing technology to catapult the profession into a position of power capable of dictating advertising standards and influencing legislation. The significance of this study is its contribution to the paucity of existing knowledge of the history of Urinary Incontinence interventions. The nursing significance will outline the development of the profession as well as outlining nursing interventions and care of the incontinent person. This is the first comparison of the popular treatment with the prescribed treatment of Urinary Incontinence in the illuminated time period."

Valuation as an economic term is used to define an entity's worth or value. As an approach, valuation encourages a company to document the financial value of both the tangible and intangible assets associated with the services provided. Today there are a limited number of studies that document the value of nursing services. Valuation studies related to nursing are challenged by the need to include the complexity of patient services that causes variation in research results. This historical case study examines one nursing initiative undertaken by the Daughters of Charity who were trained in nursing and finance and were able to demonstrate their value to the community of Jacksonville, Florida. In 1916, the Daughters of Charity came to Jacksonville to provide health care to the sick and the poor. They endured the hardships found in this southern city and endeared themselves to the community. They purchased a 42-bed Sanatorium and expanded this facility into a 528-bed hospital and health system. Across ninety years, the community supported and demonstrated their willingness to pay in order to sustain the Sisters mission. The themes identified in the study included an unwavering commitment to Jive the mission of the Daughters of Charity, an implicit authority allowing these Sisters to enter into business arrangements, an emphasis on ensuring that all Sisters gained education and mentorship in finance and nursing, the growth of a strong bond with the community of Jacksonville, and an ability to obtain funding needed to carry out their mission. Themes appearing to be in opposition to the Sisters mission included racial separation and the limited recognition given to nurses at the Sisters' hospital. In conclusion, the study tells the story of Sisters who were able to enhance their valuation by blending their knowledge of the health care business and nursing, while successfully obtaining the funding needed to fulfill their mission."

Events contributing to disease progression include the emergence of viral mutations and loss of T -helper cells. This results in a decline in overall physical well-being. One explanation for this occurrence is lack of adherence with recommended treatment plans that can result in viral mutations and replication. The health care team establishes a plan to prevent or delay this decline in health. Can clinicians expect absolute commitment to plans of care without their knowing their effects on patients' life? This study was conducted to answer the research question, ""What is the culture of living with HIV as it shapes adherence to plans of care for patients in south Florida?"" in order to understand HIV positive patients' responses to managing complex medical regimens. In an effort to understand the life-world and experiences of patients who are HIV positive, an ethnographic study was conducted to explore how patients manage the daily demands of living with IDV. In addition, environment of care was observed to determine if it influenced adherence to medications and plans of care. Through the use of ethnography, interviews of IDV positive patients were conducted, several of whom had significant adherence issues and one person who might be considered an ideal patient. Several different settings were included in the research to determine what impact environment had on patients' adherence to medications and plans of care. Fear, trust, self-worth, literacy, financial and disease specific themes emerged and lead to the development of a model for adherence to plans of care for IDV positive patients. This model may enhance clinician/patient collaboration to achieve maximized health and delay progression of mv disease."
020233147,(OCoLC)182855759,http://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA00000625,"This dissertation analyzes a nursing artifact: the infant/invalid feeder. A material culture analysis, developed by the author, is utilized for the in depth study of 12 feeders. This work assumes that Caring is the core value of what constitutes nursing and nursing practice. The expression of the aesthetics of nursing through the act of feeding and use of infant/invalid feeders, aesthetic knowing and expression of that knowing, links caring and caring presence. The act of feeding another, whether sick or infant has been the domestic sphere of women throughout history and is also considered one of the most important duties of the nurse. For centuries women have provided nourishment to others. Much of this has been accomplished through the use of utensils designed specifically for the purpose of feeding those too ill or young to independently do so themselves. Material culture study, a method of examining artifacts and the cultural messages that they contain is employed as the methodology for research. A detailed investigation of the nursing literature reveals that there have been no material culture studies of nursing's artifacts to date. In this dissertation the author designed and utilized her own model for the analysis of 12 invalid feeders. The material culture analysis of the twelve feeders leads to a greater understanding of the history and evolution of nursing practice in the United States. Significance and recognition of feeders in England and their continued use versus their obscurity and unfamiliarity in the United States serves an example of the changes and differences that have occurred within the social context of the culture as a whole and nursing culture in particular. Feeding of patients with feeders by nurses serves as an example of the complexities of human caring and the aesthetic practice of nursing. Nurses can gain from the material culture studies of nursing artifacts, paying greater attention to the ways that make us human and humane. This work has related the caring and the aesthetic of nursing practice to the everyday act of feeding and challenges nurses to continue to find ways to demonstrate nurturing and caring to those we have the privilege to nurse."

Chaos Theory within Complexity Sciences and Ray's Bureaucratic Caring Theory informed the study. The Swinderman Research Model was created to visualize the tension between order and chaos in nursing practice. Twelve nurse informaticians were interviewed about their experiences in designing, building, implementing and supporting electronic nursing documentation systems using van Marten's human science phenomenological method. Descriptive themes where illuminated and metathemes were interpreted from the research data. The universal whole of nursing informatics was expressed as self-in-relation through the metaphor of magnetic appeal linking the metathemes of inspired leadership and education, caring relationships, complexity, and technology. The metaphor of magnetic appeal illuminates the nurse informatician as the embodiment of caring with gifts as educator, negotiator, translator, and liaison. The Swinderman Research Model was enhanced using the research to create further the Swinderman Conceptual Model for Nursing Informatics. Chaos Theory within Complexity Sciences facilitated the understanding of the subtle dynamic patterns of flux and flow and choice-making in nursing. The Swinderman Conceptual Model for Nursing Informatics emerged as the future of Nursing Informatics in the transformation from handwritten to electronic nursing documentation in complex healthcare organizations."
