In particular, this study empirically examines the different valuation weights that capital market participants attach to accrual-based versus cash flow-based measures when valuing intangible-intensive, high-technology stocks, and finds that investors appear to value, on average, a dollar of cash flows higher than a dollar of accruals for intangible-intensive high-technology firms. Based on samples of Compustat high- and low-technology firms between 1992--2001, the empirical results suggest that cash flows have larger multiplier than aggregate accruals, and have incremental value-relevant information beyond that contained in the individual components of accruals for valuing high-technology stocks. This study further provides evidence that suggests that cash earnings measures of low-technology firms are dominated by those of high-technology firms as a summary indicator of share values. This study contributes to existing literature that reports no substantial difference in the value relevance of cash flow and accrual amounts in high and low tech industries. It provides evidence that suggests that capital market investors do not hold high-tech stocks to the same standards of valuation that they use for low-tech traditional stocks.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FADT120552 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2003.03411ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000050002400041049000900065100003900074245013400113300005800247502004600305504005600351650004900407650005400456650002700510650002800537650007500565650008000640650005400720650005300774040002300827264006200850336002600912337002600938338003600964655003801000520192201038856003902960710008602999061208s2006    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001.5b.A455 2006  aFGME1 aAl-Moshaigeh, Abdullah I.,eauthor14aThe effect of self-efficacy on the decisions to enroll and succeed in internet accounting courses /cby Abdullah I.

The study is motivated by the many calls for research to apply social cognitive theory to determine factors of motivation and consequently success of accounting students in an online education environment. Social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) is used to develop the hypotheses tested in the current study. Three groups of hypotheses were developed. The first group of hypotheses tests the relationships among academic self-efficacy, computer self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy, and academic goal. The second group of hypotheses tests the relationships among academic self-efficacy, computer self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy, computer anxiety, Internet anxiety, gender and instruction mode. The third group of hypotheses tests the relationships among academic self-efficacy, academic goal, computer self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy, computer anxiety, Internet anxiety, gender, instruction mode and self-assessment of performance. The study's results support the hypothesis that Internet self-efficacy is a significant predictor of whether accounting students will enroll in campus-based courses or Internet-based courses when they have the choice of instruction mode. The results also indicate that gender is a significant predictor of instruction mode. Moreover, the results indicate that academic self-efficacy is a significant predictor of accounting students' academic goals. Finally, the results indicate that computer self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy, academic goal, academic self-efficacy, computer anxiety, and Internet anxiety are significant predictors of accounting students' self-assessment of performance.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/122072 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2006.03313ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000050002400041049000900065100003100074245008900105300005700194502004600251504005700297650004300354650002800397650003000425650004700455650005400502650006900556650007300625650005600698040002300754264006200777336002600839337002600865338003600891655003800927520189700965856003902862710008602901061215s2006    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001.5b.A558 2006  aFGME1 aAlmutairi, Ali R.,eauthor14aThe economic consequences of auditor industry specialization /cby Ali R.

Unlike auditors without industry expertise, auditors with industry expertise can better improve the credibility of financial statements (Krishnan 2003; Balsam et al. 2003) and verify management forecasts, thereby minimizing management's discretion in applying accounting principles and standards (Kwon 1996). This suggests that industry specialist auditors can enhance audit quality. Consequently, clients of industry specialist auditors are expected to achieve more significant economic benefits than clients of nonspecialist auditors. Based on product differentiation theory and signaling theory, it is hypothesized in this study that clients of industry specialist auditors are more likely to enjoy a lower level of information asymmetry and a lower cost of debt than clients of nonindustry specialist auditors. In addition, this study hypothesizes that the marginal economic value added by auditor industry specialization varies between financially troubled clients and financially healthy clients that seek external financing. The results indicate that clients of specialists experience a lower information asymmetry level than clients of nonspecialists. This economic value provided by specialists is important and more pronounced for unregulated firms than for regulated firms. This inference, however, does not hold when information asymmetry is measured using analyst forecast dispersion. In addition, clients hiring specialists enjoy better credit ratings and lower cost of debt than clients of nonspecialists, and this economic value is more significant for financially troubled firms than for financially healthy firms. However, these findings do not hold for each proxy of auditor industry specialization.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/121912 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2006.03858ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000043003000041050002400071049000900095100003200104245018600136300005800322502004600380500001000426504005800436650002700494650003700521650003900558650003300597650004900630650004900679040002300728264006200751336002600813337002600839338003600865655003800901520246500939856004203404710008603446050217s2003    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  aa-su---aa-ku---aaw----- 4aHF001.5b.A572 2003  aFGME1 aAlsalman, Ahmad M.,eauthor14aThe value relevance of accounting numbers and the implications for international accounting standards harmonization :bevidence from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait /cby Ahmad M.

The motivation for this study arises from ongoing accounting harmonization efforts to increase the comparability of financial reporting across countries. Proponents of harmonization agree that investors support the need for comparability. Opponents, on the other hand, argue that efforts toward a common set of accounting standards worldwide may not achieve comparability as long as economical, cultural, and political differences exist across countries. So, the question is whether the application of common accounting standards result in enhanced comparability of financial statements, given that firms operate in different countries with different regulatory and cultural influences. This study examines the relationship between reported financial figures and both stock prices and returns across Saudi, Kuwait, the U.S., and U.S. listed firms that use international accounting standards (IAS-sample) to determine whether there are differences in the value relevance of their accounting numbers. Saudi and Kuwait have similar environments. However, they use different GAAPs. Saudi uses U.S. GAAP and Kuwait uses IAS. As a benchmark, this study uses samples of firms that use U.S. GAAP, and that use IAS, with both samples listing in the U.S. capital market. To determine whether accounting standards play a large role in differences in value relevance across these countries, four comparisons are performed: (1) Saudi and the U.S.; (2) Kuwait and IAS-sample; (3) Saudi and Kuwait; and (4) the U.S. and IAS-sample. The results show that there are significant differences in the value relevance between countries that apply the same standards but have different institutional factors. On the other hand, there are no significant differences, in most cases, in the value relevance between countries that apply different standards but operate in a similar environment. Moreover, this study attempts to determine whether earnings conservatism differs across these countries. This study provides evidence that institutional factors affect the differences in earnings conservatism. The findings of this study suggest that international harmonization of accounting standards may not be easily accomplished because institutional factors play an influential role in information dissemination.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FADT120792 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2003.02569ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000050002300041049000900064100003300073245011300106300005800219502004600277504005600323650003500379650002900414650003700443650005500480650006300535650006100598040002300659264006200682336002600744337002600770338003600796655003800832520127200870856003902142710008602181030619s2002    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001.5b.A57 2002  aFGME1 aAlshinifi, Saleh H.,eauthor14aThe market valuation of the effect of the tax amortizability of purchased goodwill /cby Saleh H.

Specifically, the study tests whether a significant positive change exists in the market reaction to acquisitions qualifying for the Internal Revenue Code section 197. Two methodologies are employed in the examination of the market assessment of the effect of the Internal Revenue Code section 197. First, a market model methodology is utilized in order to pre examine whether the market reacted differently to acquisitions that qualified for goodwill tax deductibility relative to acquisitions that did not. Second, multiple regression models were obtained for testing the study's hypotheses. The results of this study support the hypothesis that a positive change exists in the market reaction to acquisitions that qualify for the internal revenue code 197 relative to those that do not. There are two implications for these findings. First, they imply that acquiring firms did retain some of the tax benefits associated with the change in the tax law. Second, and given the findings of previous studies, the findings of this study also imply that the expected tax savings are actually shared between the acquiring firm and the target's shareholders.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/120202 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2002.01986ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002000053049000900073100003200082245019000114300005800304502004600362504005800408650005900466650006000525650002400585650007100609650007000680650005000750651004500800040002300845264006200868336002600930337002600956338003600982655003801018520045901056856003901515710010601554851028s1974    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001b.A5 1974  aFGME1 aAnderson, Bruce M.,eauthor14aThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 :bits genesis, implementation and impact (including a case study of the Texas Gulf Coast petrochemical industry) /cby Bruce M.

National level indicators are scantily represented in IT adoption or diffusion theory. Empirical results on this are almost absent in literature. Diffusion theory models of Rogers (1985) and Kwon and Zmud (1987) do not address national level attributes. National level indicators like culture, economy, institutional factors, physical distance from the innovating nation, IT infrastructure etc., could all be relevant to IT diffusion. Three types of major models (models based on adoption and growth rate factors and diffusion rate) are introduced and the effects of national indicators are examined. First, a general model is developed showing the relationship of various national factors with IT adoption and growth rate. The adoption and growth rates of nine IT products/paradigms are examined in context of the model posited. The hypotheses tested include: (1) IT adoption and growth rate is related to national value systems based on Inglehart's and Hofstede's dimensions, even after controlling for major economic and other indicators; (2) IT adoption and growth rate is related to economic as well as institutional and other national level factors; (3) The factors of adoption and growth rate of IT products/phenomena are different for different products/paradigms. Next, non-linear (temporal as well as space-time) diffusion models are used for modeling the diffusion process. For this purpose, mathematical models are developed and assessed. These models provide additional contributions in the area of diffusion model development. Time-series data on various countries are researched and gathered for this purpose.

However, influences of trust on intentions to provide personal information to complete the transaction, and influences of trust in the product category, and/or in the brand, on intentions to transact, have received little attention. This research fills the gap in the exiting literature by understanding the influence of product category trust, brand trust and vendor trust on intentions to transact online, a combination of intentions to purchase and intentions to provide personal information to complete the transaction. Hypotheses of the influence of the trust variables on intentions to transact were tested using a computer simulated Internet web-site and two products in a 2 (product trust) x 2 (brand trust) x 2 (vendor trust) between-subject factorial design with replication, and a sample of 422 subjects. Findings suggest that channel trust still influences online intentions to transact and that product category trust, particularly for product categories with low past experience, also influences online intentions to transact. Additionally, findings also suggest that brand trust may be as important as vendor trust in influencing online intentions to transact. Findings suggest that Internet vendors will benefit from carrying trusted brands and from increasing consumer trust towards the Internet as a shopping channel.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/122042 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2006.02429ctm a2200397Ii 4500008004100000043002100041050002400062049000900086100003100095245006000126300005900186502004600245504005800291651003800349650003600387650003200423650002800455651006100483650004900544650004800593650005800641650006400699650005400763651004300817651004500860648002200905040002300927264006200950336002601012337002601038338003601064655003801100520076401138856004301902710008601945090115s2008    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  aaw-----an-us--- 4aHF001.5b.B455 2008  aFGME1 aBen Mrad, Selima.,eauthor10aDo consumers forgive and forget? /cby Selima Ben Mrad.  a1 online resource (xii, 169 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

It is with such a context in mind that the animosity of consumers in the Middle East is examined and whether that animosity affects the willingness to buy. In this study, the intention is to understand consumers' internal motivations behind their refusal to buy American products. Is it just to express anger, to punish the United States, or just to enhance their images, that consumers in the Middle East refuse to buy American products? In addition, the goal is to go a step further and to investigate whether animosity is expressed across different religious groups.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003002 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2008.03290ctm a2200349Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002300053049000900076100002900085245007500114300006000189502004600249504005800295650004200353650005800395650004400453650002700497650008400524650005300608650005300661650007000714651004500784040002300829264006200852336002600914337002600940338003600966655003801002520177201040856004202812710008602854050207s2004    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001.5b.B42 2004  aFGME1 aBenou, Georgia.,eauthor10aEssays on high-tech acquisitions and divestitures /cby Georgia Benou.  a1 online resource (xiii, 161 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

This dissertation examines the takeover and divestiture activity in high-tech markets in an effort to extend our current knowledge regarding high-tech companies. In that context, various firm characteristics and their relation to firm performance are investigated. Furthermore, an attempt is made to examine the role of investment banks and their impact---if any---on shareholder wealth. This study finds that for domestic high-tech acquisitions, the higher the level of the target's R&D expenditures, the lower the bidder's announcement period wealth effects. Furthermore, the more MEDIA attention the tech target receives prior to the acquisition the more favorably investors react to news about the acquisition. This finding is common both for domestic and international tech acquisitions. Findings on the role of investment bank advisors vary across the three studies. Essay 1 shows that high-tech acquisitions advised by top-tier investment banks perform worse upon announcement than acquisitions advised by lower-tier investment banks. In Essay 2 the tier of the investment bank advisor makes a difference only during the difficult and uncertain years of the tech downturn time period. Finally, in Essay 3 it is found that sellers benefit from the presence of an investment bank advising the buyer, suggesting that whenever the buyer uses an investment bank, the assets are divested at a high price. However, it is only during the years following the end of the tech-bubble period that buying-firm shareholders reacted less favorably to acquisitions of high-tech divested assets certified by an investment bank.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FADT121012 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2004.03322ctm a2200265Ii 4500008004100000050002300041049000900064100003000073245007500103300006000178502004600238504005800284650002200342650002100364650004800385650004700433040002300480264006200503336002600565337002600591338003600617655003800653520232600691856003903017990609s1998    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001.5b.B47 1998  aFGME1 aBers, Martina K.,eauthor14aThe performance persistence of closed-end funds /cby Martina K.

Because closed-end funds trade at market prices different from net asset value (NAV) they are used to test both the performance persistence of their NAV and market price returns. While research has assessed the performance persistence of open-end funds, it has not assessed the performance persistence of closed-end funds. Yet, the unique characteristics of closed-end funds allow stronger arguments for their persistence than the arguments previously submitted for open-end funds. The characteristics that can potentially cause closed-end fund return persistence to be different from open-end fund return persistence include investor sentiment, restrictions on liquidity of underlying assets and cash holdings, and performance pressure on fund managers. This study also investigates the NAV and market price return persistence of international closed-end funds. This group of funds is of particular interest because investor sentiment determines a large portion of the market price return. In addition, as some international markets are less efficient due to restricted flow of information, fund managers may have an advantage in portfolio selection. Finally, this study examines cross-sectionally whether the persistence measure is related to the fund characteristics size, goal, management fees, turnover, fund family, fund experience, and the stock exchange a fund is traded on. The results show evidence for NAV and market price performance persistence, which is stronger for past winning than losing funds. NAV return persistence is less for foreign than domestic funds, possibly due to exchange rate fluctuations. However, market price return persistence is greater for foreign than domestic funds, which may indicate that price pressure is affecting foreign funds more than domestic funds. Funds with lower expense ratios, funds that are not members in a fund family, and funds traded on the NYSE show more persistence of strong NAV and market price performance. The results imply that investors should benefit from investing in past winning funds. This is particularly true for foreign funds, funds with lower expense ratios, funds that are not members of a fund family, and funds traded on the NYSE.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/1255103822ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002300053049000900076100002500085245009500110300006000205502004600265504005800311651005100369650004000420651003400460650004800494650006600542651003800608651006400646040002300710264006200733336002600795337002600821338003600847655003800883520245000921856003903371710008603410010425s2000    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  ae------14aHF001.5b.B54 2000  aFGME1 aBley, Jorg.,eauthor10aFinancial market integration and cross-border spillover effects in Europe /cby Jorg Bley.  a1 online resource (xvii, 324 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

The introduction of the single European currency, the euro, eliminated a traditional source of risk to international portfolio investors. In light of these developments, Part I of the empirical analysis had the following objectives: (1) to determine the relative importance of country, sector, and industry factors in explaining individual company's stock return behavior in the wake of the formation of the European Union, (2) to identify the multiple factor model, consisting of country and/or sector and/or industry factors, that was best at explaining European stock returns over the observation period, (3) to discover cross-sectional differences and non-stationarity in the industry portfolio return sensitivity to country, sector, and industry factors, (4) to find out whether the European market had become more independent from the other two major trading areas, the US and the Pacific Rim, over the period 6/1994 to 6/1999, and (5) to quantify industry structure-related changes in portfolio diversification benefits in European stock portfolios. Diversification benefits of country portfolios still outweighed diversification benefits of European industry portfolios. However, evidence was found for a gradual change in the degree of homogeneity within European industries in the wake of the ongoing harmonization of European financial markets. It seems reasonable to assume diversification effects in the future to become even more pronounced for portfolios generated within a country market but across industries. The main objective of Part II, was to determine the valuation effects of merger and acquisition announcements on national rivals (intra-industry effects) and European rivals (inter-country effects). Conducting various cross-sectional return analyses, country and industry-specific sources of intra-industry effects and inter-country effects were identified. With the elimination of foreign exchange rate risks, following the introduction of the single currency on January 1, 1999, cross-border spillover effects have become more pronounced. The hypothesis that the introduction of the euro facilitates the transmission of (private) information across geographic markets boundaries is clearly supported by the findings of the cross-sectional regression analysis.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/126402 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2000.02624ctm a2200337Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002000053049000900073100004900082245017900131300004300310502004600353504005800399650006500457650006500522650005400587650006400641650005300705650006400758651005700822040002300879264005600902264001100958336002600969337002600995338003601021655003801057520104601095856003902141710010602180850930s1973    xx      obm   000 0 eng d  an-us-ca 4aHF001b.B6 1973  aFGME1 aBlough, Robert T.,q(Robert Thurman)eauthor13aAn investigation of potential physician participation in an innovative, pre-paid health care program for welfare patients in Orange County, California /cby Robert T.

This thesis investigates potential participation of conservatively oriented physicians in such a program. A direct mail questionnaire to the total physician membership of the Orange County Medical Association was utilized to determine patterns of medical practice in orange county, involvement of physicians in current welfare programs, and criteria acceptable to physicians that would effectively implement a program providing quality medical services readily accessible to welfare patients. Secondary research concentrated on current concepts and actual practice in the provision, the cost, and the quality of health care provided welfare patients. Data gathered gives a degree of insight to the medical leadership in Orange County whether an innovative pre-paid health care program will attract sufficient physician participation to justify the signing of a formal contract with the State of California.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135862 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1973.03899ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000024001700041050002300058049000900081100003100090245009100121300005800212502004600270504005800316650002700374650004000401650002900441650013600470650005300606650006600659650005500725040002300780264006200803336002600865337002600891338003600917655003800953520245700991856003903448710008603487940106s1993    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d8 aZBWT00803111 4aHF001.5b.B67 1993  aFGME1 aBorde, Stephen F.,eauthor10aForeign and domestic contraction :btheory and empirical tests /cby Stephen F.

Two primary research questions are addressed: (1) What are the wealth effects associated with divestiture of foreign and domestic subsidiaries? (2) How do firm-specific and macroeconomic conditions affect these wealth effects? Various methodologies are used to empirically test theories and hypotheses. Two samples of divestitures that occurred between 1979 and 1991 are used. One sample consists of 111 divestitures of foreign subsidiaries by U.S. firms, and the other sample consists of 148 divestitures of domestic subsidiaries by U.S. firms. The results of this study are relevant to corporate managers, investors, security analysts, and other researchers. Foreign and domestic divestitures elicit positive short-run valuation effects of about 1 and 2 percent respectively. In the long run, firms that divest foreign subsidiaries increase in value on average by about 15 percent over a 5 year post-divestiture period. Conversely, firms that divest domestic subsidiaries decrease in value on average by about 11 percent over the 5 years that follow divestiture. No significant change in firm risk is associated with foreign or domestic divestitures. Relations between short-run and long-run valuation effects in the sample of domestic divestitures are positive and significant for periods of up to 4 years after divestiture, but for foreign divestitures, such relations are not significant. This suggests that the market adjusts more slowly but seems to more accurately predict the long run impact of domestic divestitures. Large divestitures elicit large valuation effects. Financially strong firms divesting foreign subsidiaries experience less favorable valuation effects. Greater valuation effects result from divestiture of unrelated subsidiaries. Strategic divestitures elicit positive valuation effects in the short run but little unique effect in the long run. Domestic divestitures that occur because of liquidity problems elicit positive valuation effects. Larger valuation effects are associated with divestiture of foreign subsidiaries in industrial countries than in less developed countries. A strong U.S. dollar seems to have a positive influence on short-run valuation effects but no material influence on long-run valuation effects associated with foreign divestiture.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/123442 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1993.01883ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100002900083245007400112300004200186502004600228504005800274650001400332650003700346650004800383650004000431651004500471040002300516264006200539336002600601337002600627338003600653655003800689520070900727856003901436710010601475850930s1976    xx      obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001b.B69 1976  aFGME1 aBoyd, Thomas J.,eauthor10aNational health insurance for the United States /cby Thomas J.

Policy options available to the Congress that will shape the final form of NHI are also studied. It is concluded that access to quality health care, as the "right" of every American, and the runaway cost of health care in the 1970's have combined to create an economic "crisis" and the socio-political milieu that will lead to the enactment of national health insurance in the United States on an incremental basis beginning in 1976.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/137662 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1976.02520ctm a2200337Ii 4500008004100000050002400041049000900065100003300074245010400107300005700211502004600268500001000314504005800324650002400382650002300406650002100429650002600450650005200476650004900528650004700577650005000624040002300674264006200697336002600759337002600785338003600811655003800847520116900885856004202054710008602096050922s2005    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001.5b.B725 2005  aFGME1 aBranchik, Blaine J.,eauthor10aNet Transaction Value :btoward a unified theory of buyer decision-making /cby Blaine J.

This study proposes Net Transaction Value (NTV), a unified theory of buyer decision-making. NTV hypothesizes that a buyer makes an implicit and subjective calculation before making a purchase in a high involvement context. In making this calculation, the buyer deducts the costs anticipated from a transaction or transaction stream from its associated benefits. Benefits in the NTV equation reflect not only the product or service offering itself, but the monetary aspects of the transaction or purchase deal. Costs reflect the buyer's own self-imposed costs over and above price as well as those costs over and above price imposed by the seller on the buyer. This study uses the NTV model to develop and test the relationships between these benefit and cost variables and the buyer's perceptions of net transaction value. Results confirm that the buyer includes the benefits of the product or service offering itself and seller-imposed costs in the calculation of NTV. As a result, NTV provides a valuable tool for predicting and describing buyer decision-making.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FADT121212 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2005.02271ctm a2200337Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100003700072245006500109300005800174502004400232504005600276650003100332650005100363650003900414650005800453650004300511650006500554650008400619650007700703648002200780040002300802264006200825336002600887337002600913338003600939655003800975520080101013856003901814710008001853041004s2004    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.B754 2004  aFGME1 aBrigida, Matthew David.,eauthor10aOffshoring and wage convergence /cby Matthew David Brigida.  a1 online resource (vii, 57 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.S.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd2004  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 55-57). 0aConvergencey19th century. 0aWagesxEffect of technological innovations on. 0aHuman capitalxEconometric models. 0aLabor supplyxEffect of technological innovations on. 7aConvergence.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00877195 7aHuman capitalxEconometric models.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00962883 7aLabor supplyxEffect of technological innovations on.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00990189 7aWagesxEffect of technological innovations on.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01169619 7a1800 - 18992fast  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c2004  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThe recent advances in communication technology are changing the structure of the labor market in the United States. Jobs, which previously had to be done in the United States, can now be done offshore and thus American companies can take advantage of the wage differentials between countries. To see the potential effects that such a structural change may have on economic growth, we first examine the 19th century convergence between Europe and the New World countries. Thereafter we introduce a model of economic growth that will take into account a particular aspect of present day offshoring. Many of the workers being brought into the United States labor market are highly skilled. After this, we introduce Skill-Biased Technological Change and look at how it may be affected by offshoring.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/131252 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f2004.02235ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003700071245012600108300006300234502004600297504005600343650003900399650005600438650004100494650005800535040002300593264006200616336002600678337002600704338003600730655003800766520100800804856003901812710010601851840110s1971    xx a    obmp  000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.B78 1971  aFGME1 aBruce, Margaret Irma M.,eauthor10aTeaching methodology using audio-programmed instructional system for ten-key adding machine /cby Margaret Irma M.

Method and Sources: Two levels of students, secondary and post secondary, were divided into equal-sized control and experimental groups. The control groups followed the traditional method; the experimental groups were instructed by specially prepared audio instructional tapes with a correlated program folder of examples, exercises, and evaluations . All groups were given an achievement test evaluating speed and accuracy in addition and efficiency in applicable business problems. Findings: Experimental groups achieved higher mean scores. At the .05 level of significance, there was a significant difference in achievement in favor of the experimental group at the high school level. Students liked the audio method. There was indication that both student and teacher productivity increased.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/134622 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1971.01750ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003700071245011100108300005800219502004600277504005800323610003000381610005600411650002800467650005400495040002300549264006200572336002600634337002600660338003600686655003800722520056700760856003901327710010601366841109s1977    xx a    obms  000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.B88 1977  aFGME1 aButler, Wilford Arthur.,eauthor10aAlumni perceptions of services and activities of Delta Upsilon Fraternity /cby Wilford Arthur Butler, Jr.  a1 online resource (ix, 189 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1977  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 186-189).20aDelta Upsilon Fraternity.27aDelta Upsilon Fraternity.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00577819 0aGreek letter societies. 7aGreek letter societies.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00947430  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1977  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThe purpose of this study was to determine alumni perceptions of services and activities presently provided in Delta Upsilon Fraternity and to conduct market research on alumni preferences for avariety of services and activities in the future.

Long-run economic growth is explained by the exogenous variable, technology. In this model lower income countries will experience higher rates of economic growth, which will lead to convergence in the standards of living between low-income and high-income countries. Additional theories including the augmented Solow model, which tests for conditional convergence and endogenous growth theories have been developed recently. An empirical inquiry of the convergence hypothesis has been conducted using a variety samples based on income classifications and geographical locations.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/154852 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1997.04336ctm a2200349Ii 4500008004100000050002400041049000900065100003200074245023600106300005800342502004600400504005800446650003300504650002500537650002400562650003800586650003600624650005900660650005100719650005000770650006400820650006200884040002300946264006200969336002601031337002601057338003601083655003801119520270001157856004303857710008603900080926s2007    xx a    obmu  000 0 eng d 4aHF001.5b.B972 2007  aFGME1 aByramjee, Framarz.,eauthor14aThe influence of consumers' perspectives of transaction costs in business-to-consumer markets, their risk-bearing propensity, and the categories of goods purchased on consumers' preference of shopping medium /cby Framarz Byramjee.  a1 online resource (ix, 169 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

To better understand what influences consumers' choices to shop for products or services on the internet versus local retail stores, this study tests the influence of consumers' transaction costs, coupled with the risk-bearing propensity of individuals (risk-taking or risk-averse attitude) in a shopping context, and the category of goods involved in the purchase process (such as search or experience goods), which will ultimately influence consumers' preference of shopping medium (such as online or traditional). This research study introduces the construct of consumers' transaction costs as an important predictor of consumers' preference of shopping medium, develops two segregated categories of consumers' transaction costs, namely the individual costs and the social costs, and implements a system of measurement of these costs with regard to how much they matter to individual consumers with regard to their preference of shopping medium. Several pretests were initially conducted to operationalize the variables and their measurement scales, and to validate the manipulation checks employed for the study. The data for the main study was then collected via four versions of the designed and pre-tested survey instrument, employing a between-subjects design, and subject to the appropriate statistical analyses. The results convey that individuals with higher risk-bearing propensity would prefer the online shopping medium, while individuals with lower risk-bearing propensity would prefer the traditional shopping medium. Further, search goods would have a greater tendency to be bought online, while experience goods would have a greater tendency to be bought in-store. These findings bear support to past literature wherein similar results have been found, and serve to strengthen these conjectures. With regard to the effects of consumers' transaction costs, the individual costs and the social costs tend to only influence consumers' reference of shopping medium without providing a sense of the actual choice of medium. Further, the nonsignificant interaction effects of individuals' risk-bearing propensity and goods' categories with consumers' transaction costs imply that these variables do not moderate the impact of transaction costs on consumers' preference of shopping medium. The study then discusses the analytical and theoretical reasoning pertaining to these results, along with the managerial implications which this research bears, and the limitations of this study which could warrant potential future research.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003012 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2007.01746ctm a2200313Ii 4500008004100000029002100041043001200062050002100074049000900095100002900104245009900133300005700232502004600289504005600335650004000391650005600431650007400487650005800561651003800619040002300657264006200680336002600742337002600768338003600794655003800830520041900868856003901287710010601326850930s1977    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d1 aNLGGCb082370354  ancpn--- 4aHF001b.C32 1977  aFGME1 aCabal, Tomas A.,eauthor14aThe effects of labor legislation on the Panamanian construction industry /cby Tomas A.

This study was implemented by the use of a random sample, along with a content analysis. As a result of this research it was discovered that the primary reason for this action was an economic motive. It was further learned that none of the offering agencies played upon this economic factor in their promotional appeals. Therefore, the following has been concluded: the consumer's purchase of service maintenance contracts was not made due to the efforts on the part of the selling a gents, but rather in spite of them. And, the total market for service maintenance contracts has been restricted because of insufficient stimulation on the part of the selling agents.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/126502 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.01646ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100002900072245014700101300004000248502004600288504005800334650002700392650005300419040002300472264006200495336002600557337002600583338003600609655003800645520056400683856003901247710010601286890210r19861973xx      obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.C38 1973a  aFGME1 aCauthen, Ollie.,eauthor10aNew plant site selection :ba study of various factors with emphasis on human resource considerations in the decision /cby Ollie Cauthen, Jr.  a1 online resource (v, 143 leaves ;)  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1973  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 142-143). 0aIndustrial management. 7aIndustrial management.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00971246  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1973  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aTho problem of the study was to investigate tho relative importance of various factors which influence tho now plant site selection decision, Tho study method of inquiry was employed using a questionnaire survey which was sent to two populations--a group of chemical operations and selected companies from the Fortune 500 list, Primary emphasis was placed on human resource considerations.

The primary research objective deals with strong-form market efficiency. The test strives to determine if the results of information held by investment bankers are attributable to inside information or information that is available to anyone willing to research and analyze particular target firms. A second research objective is to examine why larger wealth effects are expected. Potential reasons examined include internal and external governance issues, as well as acquisition activity as a means of governance. Specific issues examined are (1) a change in the chief executive officer after acquisition, (2) a change in the board of directors after acquisition, (3) an increase in the debt ratio of the target firm after acquisition, (4) downsizing and/or exiting from an industry after acquisition, and (5) to stop the selection of poor acquisitions by the target firm. The relative size of the acquisitions is controlled for in both groups; economies of scale realized from horizontal or vertical acquisitions are controlled for in the case of the control group. A comparison of the wealth gains between the two groups reveals that investment bankers outperform non-investment bankers when the average holding period abnormal return is used as the wealth measure. However, when cumulative average abnormal returns are compared, the non-investment banker group realizes higher wealth gains than the investment bankers. In no case does either group outperform a market index, the S&P 500. The results of the wealth effect tests support strong-form market efficiency; investment bankers do not utilize private information to realize gains from closely-held information. Primarily, downsizing is associated with positive effects on the stock price returns of target firms in partial acquisitions by investment bankers. Non-investment banker partial acquisitions are characterized with a change in the chief executive officer of the target firm. This change, however, is negatively associated with the share price returns of the target firms.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/123992 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1995.01934ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003300071245007900104300005800183502004400241504005100285650001300336650002100349650004700370650003900417040002300456264006200479336002600541337002600567338003600593655003800629520087000667856003901537710008001576991020s1999    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001b.C52 1999  aFGME1 aClarke, Mark Wayne.,eauthor10aSmoking or not smoking? :ba logit model analysis /cby Mark Wayne Clarke.  a1 online resource (vii, 55 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.S.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1999  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaf 55). 0aSmoking. 0aCigarette smoke. 7aCigarette smoke.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00861367 7aSmoking.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01121689  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1999  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aSince the beginning of President Clinton's administration, the cigarette industry has been under a lot of pressure to change the way they do business, how they advertise. This study was not intended to be for or against the issue of smoking but to see which variable affects smoking after the consumer makes the adult decision to smoke. Three different econometric analyses were used to come up with these results; Logit, OLS and Linear Probability Model. The findings indicate that variables like income, pack per week smoked, age, years smoking and gender are significant in determining if an adult consumer continues to smoke. In addition, age, race, and years smoking are good indicators of whether a smoker is or is not price conscious. Years smoking, age, and education of a smoker's mother also have an effect on how much cigarettes an adult smoker consumes.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/156232 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1999.02319ctm a2200349Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100003200083245009700115300005700212502004400269504005600313650002200369650002900391650001200420650002500432650005500457650003800512650005100550650003900601651003900640040002300679264006200702336002600764337002600790338003600816655003800852520096000890856003901850710008001889970528s1996    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us-fl 4aHF001b.C64 1996  aFGME1 aCollins, Donald L.,eauthor10aTranslog and Cobb-Douglas analysis of demand for tourism in Florida /cby Donald L.

The study is made on the state level of each association used in the research. It evaluates whether there is a difference between the perceived values of the twenty reasons, whether there is a difference between the perceived values as given by association executives as compared to new members, and whether there is a difference between the perceived values as given by representatives of the company member associations as compared to those given by the individual member associations.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/137672 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1976.03522ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000029002300041050002300064049000900087100003300096245017500129300004000304502004600344500001000390504005800400650002300458650002800481650004400509650005400553650007000607650004900677040002300726264006200749336002600811337002600837338003600863655003800899520213400937856003903071710008603110931221s1993    xx      obm   000 0 eng d1 aDEBBGbBV009961370 4aHF001.5b.C87 1993  aFGME1 aCushing, Woodrow W.,eauthor10aOn the interaction between the investment and financing decision :ban extension and empirical test of the Williamson specificity hypothesis /cby Woodrow W.

The Williamson asset specificity hypothesis asserts that the financial leverage used by firms is a function of the specificity of the assets owned by the firm when asset specificity is defined as the readiness with which assets can be re-deployed. This results from a governance argument whereby highly specific assets can only be governed by increased equity participation. This argument is extended with the assertion that increased specificity causes operating leverage to rise and that firms counter this increased operating leverage by decreasing the financial leverage they employ. Liquidation value is employed as a proxy measure for how readily assets can be converted to cash. Data was gathered for a sample of firms who have liquidated and include firms liquidated in bankruptcy and firms liquidated voluntarily. Using these data a model is developed to estimate the liquidation value of any firm. A cross-sectional time-series formulation is employed using data gathered for thirty-six firms over a twenty-two year period. A statistically significant positive relationship was found to exist between the estimated liquidation value and financial leverage which supports the Williamson asset specificity hypothesis. Neither the cross-sectional nor time series behavior of firms provides evidence of a trade-off between interest tax shields and non-debt tax shields. No significant relationship was found to exist between the value of the non-debt tax shield and financial leverage. No evidence was found indicating a relationship between operating leverage of firms and financial leverage. However, evidence was found that firms with higher percentage changes in sales from year to year, lower probabilities of failure, higher levels of financial slack, and lower values for interest tax shields use less financial leverage. Finally, evidence was found indicating that firms employed more financial leverage in the 1980's than in the 1970's.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/123432 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1993.03403ctm a2200385Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002300053049000900076100002800085245011600113300004200229502004600271500001000317504005800327650006100385650004700446650004300493650002300536650004100559650007100600650004900671650005700720650005400777650006700831651004500898040002300943264006200966336002601028337002601054338003601080655003801116520173801154856003902892710008602931951117s1994    xx      obm   000 0 eng d  an-us---14aHF001.5b.D33 1994  aFGME1 aDahmus, Sue A.,eauthor14aThe link between CEO compensation, CEO resource allocation decisions, and firm performance /cby Sue A.

The firms (Forbes-CEOs of the largest 800 public companies) had the same CEO for the entire period. The resource allocation decisions and the measures of firm performance (ROA, ROE, ROI, ROS, cashflow/sales, and stock return) were obtained from COMPUSTAT. The number of acquisitions was obtained from Mergers and Acquisitions. The percent of CEO compensation at risk was found to be associated with the change in R&D and the change in the number of business segments. Total CEO compensation was found to be positively associated with the change in advertising expenses, the change in the number of employees, and the change in the number of acquisitions. A principal components analysis indicated that the performance measures loaded on two factors, representing firm profitability and returns to stockholders. The relationship between CEO compensation and firm performance was explored using two stage simultaneous equations. The model considered the effects of prior firm performance on the relationship. The amount of total CEO compensation and the percent of CEO compensation at risk were found to be positively associated with subsequent firm profitability for several years. Total CEO compensation and the percent of CEO compensation at risk were positively associated with subsequent return to stockholders in one year. However, the results were not consistent across all the years of the study and the amounts of firm performance explained by the models were small.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/123932 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1994.01864ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100004000071245010000111300005900211502004600270504005600316650002300372650002700395650004900422650005300471040002300524264006200547336002600609337002600635338003600661655003800697520070600735856003901441710010601480881114s1987    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.D26 1987  aFGME1 aDanaher, Mary Schindlbeck.,eauthor13aAn experimental study of an information-based complexity metric /cby Mary Schindlbeck Danaher.  a1 online resource (viii, 68 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.A.S.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1987  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 66-68). 0aComputer programs. 0aMultivariate analysis. 7aComputer programs.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00872410 7aMultivariate analysis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01029105  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1987  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThrough a small contained environment, this study evaluates an information-based complexity metric theory and its relationship to the effort expended in constructing a program. The metric, which calculates the amount of information present in a program specification, determines the specification's complexity measure. The observed measures of programmer effort were the numbers of keystrokes, insertions, deletions, and runs needed to complete the program specification. It was theorized that a program with a higher complexity value than that of another program will require more programmer resources to complete. A significant relationship between the metric and the number of keystrokes was found.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/144122 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.kMaster's thesis,f1987.01766ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002700053049000900080100003600089245012800125300003900253502004600292504005100338650005300389650005600442040002300498264006200521336002600583337002600609338003600635655003800671520076400709856003901473961222s1980    xx      obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHD9715.5.U6bD38 1980b  aFGME1 aDaugherty, T.

This quote was the beginning statement made during an interview by Mr. Jerry Bell, Director of the Metal Building Dealer's Association. Mr. Bell has isolated, as most important, a relationship which is responsible for over 800 million dollars of annual sales and the employment of over 14,000 people at the manufacturer's level. Countless others are employed by dealerships in the sales and construction of this relatively new system of construction which has made significant market penetration in the non-residential low rise construction market. The relative well being of this important dealer-manufacturer relationship is the subject of this study.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/1403402079ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100004600071245007800117300005700195502004600252504005600298650003700354650001200391650006300403650003800466040002300504264006200527336002600589337002600615338003600641655003800677520094100715856003901656710010601695851022s1972    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.D44 1972  aFGME1 aDe Kock, Duane E.,q(Duane Erwin)eauthor12aA value study of reasons for joining associations /cby Duane E.

The study is made on the state level of each association used in the research. It evaluates whether there is a difference between the perceived values of the twenty reasons, whether there is a difference between the perceived values as given by association executives as compared to new members, and whether there is a difference between the perceived values as given by representatives of the company member associations as compared to those given by the individual member associations.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/134982 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.03636ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000050002400041049000900065100003000074245007000104300006000174502004600234504005800280650002900338650002900367650002100396650005500417650005500472650004700527040002300574264006200597336002600659337002600685338003600711655003800747520242400785856003903209710008603248061208s2005    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001.5b.D445 2005  aFGME1 aDempere, Juan M.,eauthor10aSpecial topics in financial intermediation /cby Juan M.

The main goal of the first study is to determine the effect of some corporate governance-related variables on bank initial public offerings (IPOs). The testable hypotheses involve three dependent variables: abnormal offer price, initial return or underpricing, and long-term performance. The proposed independent variables have no explanatory power on the cross-sectional variation of the abnormal offer price. The proportion of outside directors, the size of the bank, directors and officers' (D&O) equity based compensation plans, and the age of the bank, all have a positive relationship with the level of underpricing. The variables, nominating committee independence, directors' knowledge and experience, and directors' reputation, have the hypothesized positive relationship with the sample's long-run performance. The main goal of the second research work is the analysis of a sample of self-underwritten IPOs. The analysis includes the IPOs' underpricing; long-term performance; lockup and quiet period; risk; volume; and failure and acquisitions. The main result of this study is that here are no significant differences on the level of underpricing between self-underwritten IPOs and conventional IPOs underwritten by independent underwriters. The only significant result about the long-run performance of self-underwritten IPOs is on the subsample of nonpenny stocks, where the larger the firm the lower the long-run performance. The third research work focuses on going private transactions of financial institutions. This study includes the analysis of the cross-sectional differences of the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) that result from the public announcement of a going private transaction proposal. Similarly, this study tests the long-run performance and the risk change of those firms that stay public after the withdrawal of a going private transaction. The main results suggest that public announcement of a going-private transaction produces positive CARs of about 15 percent. The public announcement of the withdrawal of a going-private transaction generates negative CARs between -4 percent and -5 percent. The total risk of the sample with respect to the matching group experiences a positive and significant increase after the public announcement of a going-private transaction proposal.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/121742 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2005.01784ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100002800071245015000099300005800249502004600307504005100353650002600404650004500430650007100475650005200546040002300598264006200621336002600683337002600709338003600735655003800771520055200809856003901361710010601400850927s1977    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.D46 1977  aFGME1 aDent, Bruce D.,eauthor12aA study of the effects of unpredictable delays on plant floor productivity using the DYNAMO language and modeling techniques /cby Bruce D.

Interorganizational relationships in channels of distribution can be considered agency relationships because they involve delegation of value-adding tasks by one participant (principal) to another participant (agent). Moral Hazard or the likelihood of an agent pursuing individual goals at the expense of mutually satisfying common goals may result in suboptimal outcomes and necessitates monitoring by the principal. Monitoring involves procuring information on the effort expended by the agent (behavior-based monitoring) and the resultant outcomes of such efforts (outcome-based monitoring). A comparison of purely economic costs in determining preferred monitoring mode without considering sociopolitical factors, such as organizational power, that influence these costs may lead to an erroneous choice of monitoring mode. An organization's power is its ability to cope with uncertainty and depends on the resources available to the organization. As resources shift from one participant to another in an agency relationship, the differential power of participants changes. This research examines how the differential power of principal and agent influences their preference for different monitoring modes. Hypotheses linking differential power, moral hazard, and the choice of monitoring mode in interorganizational agency relationships are empirically investigated with data from not-for-profit nongovernment food distribution systems established to feed the hungry. Confirmatory factor analysis is used to analyze the data and estimate measurement and structural models. All the measurement scales were developed specifically for this study and display excellent psychometric properties. Results from structural models are generally consistent with the theoretical rationale. The results indicate that higher levels of principal's propensity to assume risk result in principal preferring an outcome-based monitoring mode. Higher level of principal's accrued information lead to an outcome-based monitoring mode being preferred by the principal. Higher level of agent's accrued information lead to the principal preferring a behavior-based monitoring mode and the agent preferring an outcome-based monitoring mode. Use of side payments as incentives to align the preferred monitoring modes of the participants finds support.

One of regulators' most recent attempts to shore up auditor independence is evident in the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). As a test of two competing theories of auditor independence, and to determine whether SOX mandates have successfully enhanced financial reporting quality, I examine post-SOX changes in non-audit fees (as a proxy for changes in quasi-rents) and the extent of changes in two measures of financial reporting quality. Results suggest that SOX mandates have been effective, and that the proposition of DeAngelo (1981b) that non-audit services may impair auditor independence may more-closely describe the relationship between changes in quasi-rents and changes in financial reporting quality than does the theory of Lee and Gu (1998). Further, supplemental analyses suggest that, as proposed by the theories, the amount of low-balling is positively related to the amount of quasi-rents.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/121952 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2006.01803ctm a2200289Ii 4500008004100000043002100041050002100062049000900083100003000092245011300122300005700235502004400292504005600336650003800392650006000430651003000490650003200520040002300552264006200575336002600637337002600663338003600689655003800725520063100763856003901394710008001433990603s1997    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  af-ti---ad------14aHF001b.D68 1997  aFGME1 aDouihech, Tarek.,eauthor14aThe impact of devaluation on the standard of living of a developing country :bTunisia /cby Tarek Douihech.  a1 online resource (vi, 73 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1997  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 71-73). 0aDevaluation of currencyzTunisia. 0aDevaluation of currencyzDeveloping countrieszTunisia. 0aTunisiaxEconomic policy. 0aCurrency questionzTunisia.  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1997  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThere are conflicting theories on the effects of devaluation on economy. This thesis sets out to investigate the impact of devaluation on the standard of living of developing countries, specifically Tunisia. The results obtained from the regressions contradicted the contractionary view of devaluation. It concluded that with proper structural reforms, devaluation improves the growth rate and therefore, the standard of living of a country. Surprisingly, this negative sign of government expenditure elasticity opened up the question for further research on the impact of the role and size of a government on the growth rate.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/154602 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1997.02133ctm a2200313Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100003700083245009600120300005700216502004400273504005600317650002200373650003700395650003100432650004800463650005700511651004500568040002300613264006200636336002600698337002600724338003600750655003800786520087600824856003901700710008001739990528s1997    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us---14aHF001b.D76 1997  aFGME1 aDrpic, Ingrid Giovanna.,eauthor10aHospital mergers in the mid 1990s :bpredicting likely targets /cby Ingrid Giovanna Drpic.  a1 online resource (ix, 68 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1997  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 62-68). 0aHospital mergers. 0aHospital mergerszUnited States. 0aHospitalsxAdministration. 7aHospital mergers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00960998 7aHospitalsxAdministration.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00961176 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1997  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aConsolidation of the hospital industry is occurring at an increasing pace in the 1990s. This recent rise in mergers and acquisitions has prompted interest in what characteristics make certain hospitals good takeover targets. This study compares hospital and regional differences between 11 acquired versus 296 non-acquired hospitals in Texas one year prior to takeover in 1995. A stochastic frontier model and PROBIT model were used to determine which characteristics suggest takeover likelihood. The findings indicate that inefficiency is highly significant in predicting which hospitals make good takeover candidates. Hospitals in counties with large populations and with a large senior citizen community are also significant indicators of potential acquisition. The results suggest that these acquisitions are a market mechanism for disciplining inefficient hospitals.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/154922 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1997.02158ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100005500071245011200126300005900238502004600297504005600343650003600399650003300435650005900468650006200527040002300589264006200612336002600674337002600700338003600726655003800762520093500800856003901735710010601774841219s1971    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.D93 1971  aFGME1 aDye, Charles M.,q(Charles Melvin),d1933-eauthor14aThe computerized management laboratory :bpotential tool for business decision-making /cby Charles M.

It plans to open more. For optimum economic benefit, where should such offices be located and why? HYPOTHESIS: There is an area without a CGTB office that offers more potential tourist demand than one which already has an office. Procedure involved the use of multiple regression analysis and, for dependent variables, secondary data of automobile parties to Canada from origins in the U.S.A. Independent variables were: distance, population, income and retail sale characteristics of originating areas. Analysis showed a much stronger correlation and coefficient of determination when office territories are confined to contiguous areas. Predictive equation for the latter was significant. Applied to New Jersey, it was found that opening an office would probably induce more potential automobile tourist traffic to Canada than Southern California, where there is an office. This analysis offers a tool for such office location problems.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/134992 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.02262ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000043002100041050002100062049000900083100003400092245015900126300005700285502004400342504005600386650003500442650004300477650002700520650003500547650005400582650004600636651003700682651004500719040002300764264006200787336002600849337002600875338003600901655003800937520092200975856003901897990824s1999    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us---aa-ja---14aHF001b.E59 1999  aFGME1 aEnyart, Russell Roy.,eauthor13aAn empirical investigation of uncovered interest parity between the United States and Japan :bcointegration and causality tests /cby Russell Roy Enyart.  a1 online resource (vi, 61 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.S.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1999  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 59-61). 0aInterest rateszUnited States. 0aForeign exchange rateszUnited States. 0aInterest rateszJapan. 0aForeign exchange rateszJapan. 7aForeign exchange rates.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00931816 7aInterest rates.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00976178 7aJapan.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204082 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1999  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThis study investigates the existence of Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) between the United States and Japan. The study is conducted over a 58-month period beginning in January 1994 and continuing through October 1998. This study used unit root, cointegration, and causality tests to examine whether the exchange rates and interest rates of the two countries lent support to the UIP hypothesis. All data sets were found to contain a unit root. Further, there was no evidence for cointegration between the exchange rate and any of the explanatory variables (US interest rates, Japanese interest rates, and the interest rate differential). However, Granger-causality was discovered between the interest rate differential and the exchange rate. Thus, it can be said there is a causal relationship between the interest rate differential and the exchange rate. Lastly, this study gives some validity to the UIP hypothesis.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/1564802203ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000050002400041049000900065100003000074245009600104300006000200502004600260504005800306650003100364650001800395650002500413650005700438650004400495650005100539040002300590264006200613336002600675337002600701338003600727655003800763520098100801856003901782710008001821071023s2006    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001.5b.F355 2006  aFGME1 aFallatah, Yaser.,eauthor14aThe rold of asset reliability and auditor quality in equity valuation /cby Yaser Fallatah.  a1 online resource (viii, 136 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

The study broadly follows the Richardson et al. (2005) categorization of the reliability of accounting accruals of balance sheet components and conjectures that the role of auditor quality in equity valuation is more pronounced when asset reliability is not high. Auditor quality is measured using reputation, industry specialist and tenure metrics. The underlying assumption is that auditor quality enhances the market's perception of firm value; as such, auditor quality may mitigate the cost of security mispricing documented by Richardson et al. (2005) for low or medium reliability accruals. The results of the study provide some support that high quality auditors contribute to the valuation of equity for assets. It is less clear as to whether the value is more pronounced for low or medium reliability assets.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/122312 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f2006.01553ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000043001200041049000900053100003100062245011100093300004100204502006400245504005700309650003800366650004100404651003900445040002300484264006200507336002600569337002600595338003600621655003800657520056500695856003901260750902s1975    xx      obm   000 0 eng d  af-nr---  aFGME1 aFaluyi, Dalton O.,eauthor14aThe marketing strategies and planning of business organizational trends in Nigeria /cby Walton O.

Based on the comparative data obtained, it is possible to accept the major hypothesis that students in professional fraternal organizations are significantly different in their attitudes and personal characteristics than are students who do not belong to these organizations.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135872 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1973.02139ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100002900071245009900100300006000199502004600259504005800305650005000363650004000413650004600453650006600499040002300565264006200588336002600650337002600676338003600702655003800738520094000776856003901716710010601755851004s1973    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.F53 1973  aFGME1 aField, David W.,eauthor10aAttitudinal analysis of study manual for Ohio life insurance examination /cby David W.

It undertook a study to learn the extent of this criticism and to determine the need and market for either a new study manual or an oral training course. Questionnaires were sent to both purchasers and users. They were designed to measure the perceived adequacy of the manual and to determine characteristics respondees felt highly desirable in a superior manual. Both purchasers and users evidenced dissatisfaction extensive enough to indicate a need and a market for a new manual, but no need for an oral training course. A substantial market for a programmed learning manual was found to exist at a price of $10. Substantial dissatisfaction with the present examination was uncovered leading to a recommendation for future study of the adequacy of the examination itself.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135742 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1973.02258ctm a2200373Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002200053049000900075100002700084245008500111300005900196502004400255504005600299600003200355600005800387650003800445650005900483650003200542650002000574650004900594650007600643650006400719650004600783651003900829040002300868264006200891336002600953337002600979338003601005655003801041520068201079856004301761710008001804080418s2007    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  ae-ie--- 4aHF001b.F575 2007  aFGME1 aFiske, Brian.,eauthor10aJuicing the potato :bthe Giffen effect and market volatility /cby Brian Fiske.  a1 online resource (viii, 40 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.S.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd2007  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 39-40).10aGiffen, Robert,d1837-1910.17aGiffen, Robert,d1837-1910.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01729491 0aInvestment analysisxMathematics. 0aConsumption (Economics)xMathematical modelszIreland. 0aConsumer behaviorzIreland. 0aMicroeconomics. 7aConsumer behavior.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00876238 7aConsumption (Economics)xMathematical models.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00876463 7aInvestment analysisxMathematics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00978188 7aMicroeconomics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01019730 7aIreland.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01205427  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c2007  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThe key objective of this thesis is to explain how aggregate agent investment behavior, in the presence of a Giffen Good, leads to excess market volatility. The thesis relies on two microeconomic models. The first model demonstrates how, in the presence of a Giffen Good, the demand curve is discontinuous and upward sloping. By analyzing the demand curve, price regions of potential volatility are identified. Using the first model as a foundation, a second model is introduced in which a speculator trades in a dynamic setting. In this dynamic framework, opportunities for profit making by the speculator are identified. The speculative behavior aggravates market volatility.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003022 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f2007.01646ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100002900072245013700101300005800238502004600296504005800342650004700400650007300447040002300520264006200543336002600605337002600631338003600657655003800693520051600731856003901247710010601286851023s1974    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.F675 1974  aFGME1 aFoster, Leslie.,eauthor10aSurvey of data storage and retrieval methods with an evaluation in a selected health insurance firm /cby Leslie Hastings Foster II.  a1 online resource (ix, 116 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1974  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 111-113). 0aInformation storage and retrieval systems. 7aInformation storage and retrieval systems.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00972781  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1974  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThis was prepared as a comprehensive examination of the methods used to provide data storage and retrieval in a selected health insurance firm.

The impact of costs and technology and the growing sophistication of the industry are discussed in the context of the increasing need for greater precision in forecasting. Following a review of relevant literature in the field of econometric modelling, a regression equation was constructed which relates demand for carpets and rugs to independent macro-variables. These variables were selected on the basis of logical relationships as opposed to the screening of many variables in the hope of finding a mathematical fit. The equation accounts for 98.7 percent of past shipments and meets the appropriate statistical criteria. It was then used to project shipments of carpets and rugs for the years 1975 through 1977.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/137692 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1976.02312ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100005000071245009600121300005900217502004600276504005100322650003700373650003100410650006300441650005700504040002300561264006200584336002600646337002600672338003600698655003800734520111700772856003901889710010601928851011s1972    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.F84 1972  aFGME1 aFullarton, David C.,q(David Coleman)eauthor10aBoard-manager relationships in voluntary membership organizations /cby David C.

Very little has been written on Board of Directors-chief paid executive relationships in voluntary membership organizations. A direct mail questionnaire was used with selected groups of national association executives and telephone cooperative managers to ascertain organization structure, formality of organizational tools, personal characteristics of the executive and Board, and the executive's perception of his working environment. Annual percentage salary increase was used as the distinguishing criteria. Secondary research concentrated on common practice and theory regarding the above elements of organization. The formality of organizational tools, the chief executive's attitude toward his employees and his position, and the executive's perception of his job and of his image were found to significantly affect the Board-Manager relationship in both types of organizations studied. National associations and telephone cooperatives were affected differently by the other organizational characteristics studied.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135252 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.02307ctm a2200373Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100002800083245013600111300005700247502004600304504005800350650004300408650004200451650002900493650002600522650002100548650005400569650005300623650004700676650005200723650005500775651004500830040002300875264006200898336002600960337002600986338003601012655003801048520070201086856003901788710010601827851024s1974    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001b.G46 1974  aFGME1 aGentry, Guy C.,eauthor10aVideotape in manpower development and training :ba study of the use of videotape in business and industry /cby Guy C.

To better understand what influences consumers' choices to shop for products or services on the Internet versus local retail stores, this study tests the influence of antecedent factors of consumer patronage intentions for Internet and local retail stores. The study draws the antecedent factors from the extant literature, which include product classes, the importance consumers place on retailer attributes, and consumer perceived risk in product classes. Because the Internet instituted a convenient shopping medium with information distribution and search capabilities, nomological validity of the search, experience, and credence (SEC) product classification framework is tested in the online shopping context. This study tests the validity of the SEC product classification framework by examining whether significant differences exist in (1) the level of importance that consumers place on retailer attributes, (2) the amount and type of risks that online shoppers perceive in product classes (search, experience, and credence), and (3) their patronage intentions for two retailer types---Internet and local retail stores---based on product classes. In the same model, the study also tests the mediating effects of perceived risk in product classes in the relationship between the importance of retailer attributes and patronage intentions for retailer types. Although the relationships between some of the antecedent factors of patronage intentions have been tested in previous studies, they have never been tested jointly in the context of Internet shopping. Data were collected in three stages. The first two stages were the pretest studies that were conducted to select products as examples to represent each product category. The hypotheses were tested using data collected from a nationwide survey of those who previously purchased products or services on the Internet. The results of the analyses support the hypotheses.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/121422 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2005.04072ctm a2200349Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002300053049000900076100003300085245007600118300005900194502004600253504005800299650007300357650004100430650004700471650004100518650005200559650008400611650005200695650005700747651004500804040002300849264006200872336002600934337002600960338003600986655003801022520253701060856003903597710008603636071031s2006    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001.5b.G54 2006  aFGME1 aGlegg, Charmaine A.,eauthor10aEssays on takeover defenses and cancellations /cby Charmaine A.

The first essay examines the impact of the strength of target firms' takeover defenses on acquiring firms' probability of successfully completing takeover deals, acquiring firms' takeover wealth effects, and their long-term performance. The evidence indicates that acquirers are more likely to complete takeovers if targets have weaker defenses. Additionally, acquisition announcement cumulative abnormal returns are lower for acquirers bidding on targets with stronger defenses. However, acquiring firms underperform in the long-run, which has limited relation with targets' takeover defense strengths. The second essay examines the market's reaction to announcements of the adoption of shareholder-friendly poison pills. The market's reaction is generally favorable to poison pill announcements. Cumulative abnormal returns surrounding friendly poison pill adoptions are positive and statistically significant. Additionally, adoptions of poison pills with sunset and TIDE provisions are positively and significantly related to poison pill announcement wealth effects. However, dead hand and fiduciary out provisions have significant inverse relation with poison pill announcement cumulative abnormal returns. Poison pills with chewable, no hand, and adverse persons clauses do not significantly explain cumulative abnormal returns. The cancellation study analyzes abnormal short selling interests in target firms in the month prior to the announcement of a cancelled takeover bid. Average short selling levels are 4 or 5 times higher than normal short selling levels in the month prior to the announcement of takeover bid cancellation, and are negatively related to announcement wealth effects. These initial findings imply that short sellers may be able to anticipate the negative wealth effects associated with deal failure, and hence increase short interests to benefit from target's (albeit brief) decline in value. However, further analyses point to short sellers using market-to-fundamentals strategies, and imply that increased abnormal short selling in the month prior to the announcement of cancelled takeover bids may be coincidental.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/122222 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2006.01958ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002600053049000900079100003000088245011000118300006000228502004600288504005800334650002900392650005400421650004700475650007200522651003800594040002300632264006200655336002600717337002600743338003600769655003800805520066800843856003901511710010601550851028s1977    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-cn--- 4aHD9579.C32bG72 1977a  aFGME1 aGraham, Henry A.,eauthor10aDevelopment of human resources planning system for Canadian petrochemical industry /cby Henry A.

Special attention was given to those contemporary tools which help make an effective manpower planning system. The developed system was tested using a comprehensive questionnaire to a selected cross-section of companies currently operating in this industry. Key findings of the questionnaire were discussed. It was anticipated that the study would form the basis of a Human Resources Planning System for use within Polysar Limited.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/138812 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1977.01770ctm a2200313Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100003100083245010700114300004900221502004600270504005600316651002600372650001100398650001700409650004300426650003700469651004500506040002300551264006200574336002600636337002600662338003600688655003800724520054900762856003901311710010601350841128s1976    xx b    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001b.G76 1976  aFGME1 aGromek, Edward A.,eauthor14aThe impact of trade shows on associations and industry :ban exploratory study /cby Edward A.

The Job Descriptive Index (JDI) and its related Job-in-General scale were used to measure employee satisfaction. SERVQUAL was used to gauge general customer perceptions of service quality. A 13-item battery derived from marketing literature was used to measure customer future behavioral intentions. The customer appraisal of service provider performance was based on performance appraisal literature. Results indicated significant correlation between worker satisfaction and customer perceptions of service quality (r = .27; p < .01), customer-based appraisal of specific service provider performance (r = .30; p < .01), and customer intentions concerning doing business with the organization in the future (r = .20; p < .05). Customer quality perceptions were significantly associated with their future intentions (r = .71; p < .01) and with specific customer performance appraisal (r = .63; p < .01). However, when combined with general customer service perceptions (SERVQUAL), specific customer appraisal of service provider performance did not contribute unique predictive or explanatory capability. Unexpectedly, temporary workers' satisfaction with co-workers on their job assignment was significantly related to all customer outcome measures. The results are described and discussed in comparison with meta-analyses about job satisfaction, and in terms of other studies concerning contingent workers.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/126022 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1999.02082ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100003400072245016200106300005700268502004600325504005600371650002000427650004600447040002300493264006200516336002600578337002600604338003600630655003800666520097900704856003901683710010601722851023s1971    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.H345 1971  aFGME1 aHaldeman, William E.,eauthor13aAn analysis of buying whole life insurance versus the purchase of term insurance and investing the difference in premiums in stock /cby William E.

An analysis is made of the returns one might expect from each method of investment, based on data in the past decade. On the basis of this analysis, it would seem that a person would have fared about equally well in a choice between the two methods, provided that such person did at least as well in the selection of stock investments as the averages of stock market results (in terms of over-all income, including both capital gains and dividends). Although no conclusive choice would appear to be warranted, the uncertainties inherent in the purchase of term insurance and investment in stocks would appear to preclude such alternative for any person not wishing to speculate.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/134312 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1971.02282ctm a2200337Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100002900083245016300112300005600275502004600331504005600377650005400433650005200487650003600539650004700575650005500622650005300677651005500730651004500785040002300830264006200853336002600915337002600941338003600967655003801003520075801041856003901799710010601838841109s1972    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us-fl 4aHF001b.H35 1972  aFGME1 aHammel, Mary A.,eauthor10aVocational training under the Manpower Development and Training Act :banalyzing the job success of manpower graduates in Broward County /cby Mary A.

They would substitute price-fixing through a farm bargaining association designed to yield cost of production plus a "fair" profit to the farmer. The research done by marketing specialists and economists in most of our leading land-grant colleges indicates farm bargaining is not the panacea to greater cash returns to the farmer ... for all farm commodities. Testimony given before the House and Senate of the Ninety-Second Session of the Congress of the United States last September, October and November failed to generate the votes necessary for passage of H. R. 7597, a farm bargaining bill. Price-fixing through compulsory farm bargaining can mean higher consumer prices, substitute foods including synthetics, loss of freedom to choose with whom to do business, damaged export markets where price is critical, discrimination against non-association producers, and more federal control.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135032 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.01686ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100002700083245012700110300005700237502004600294504005100340650003700391650004700428651004600475040002300521264006200544336002600606337002600632338003600658655003800694520053100732856003901263710010601302851004s1973    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us-sc 4aHF001b.H37 1973  aFGME1 aHarms, Roy C.,eauthor13aAn investigation of consumer credit problems in the greater Columbia, South Carolina metropolitan area /cby Roy C.

This dissertation examines two corporate restructuring activities, namely (i) spinoffs and (ii) mergers and acquisitions. The first essay examines whether poison pill adoptions by impending spinoff subsidiaries is consistent with goal of shareholder wealth maximization. The main implication of my findings is that poison pills do not deter takeovers; not even in environments where takeovers are more likely. Hence, poison pill adoptions may not be motivated by entrenchment. However, since managers' motives are never clear, investors react adversely to poison pill adoptions because of concerns about potential abuse of power by management. Interestingly, the evidence suggests that poison pills have a positive effect on firm value over the longterm. One possible explanation for this finding is that the potential for abuse associated with poison pills promote shareholder activism. Since activist shareholders closely monitor managers, poison pills indirectly enhance firm value. The second essay examines whether spinoff withdrawals are in response to (i) the market reaction to the initial spinoff announcement, (ii) changes in the estimated value of the unit over the spinoff interval, and (iii) changes in expected spinoff gains owing to changes in market conditions within the subsidiary's industry. It takes 7 months to complete an announced spinoff, on average, over which time industry conditions are likely to change. The main implications of my findings are that managers learn from the market and track changes in industry conditions when making spinoff decisions. It appears that managers time spinoffs for periods when the subsidiary's industry valuations are high to fetch a better price in the market for the unit. These practices are consistent with the goal of maximizing shareholders' wealth. The third essay examines whether having outside blockholders with a higher propensity to monitor managers cause variations in (i) abnormal announcement returns, (ii) proportional wealth gains, (iii) takeover premiums, and (iv) payment methods. The evidence supports the view that the types of outside blockholders that targets and bidders have, in relation to their propensity to monitor managers, affect bargaining position. Firms that have outside blockholders with higher propensities to monitor managers experience higher takeover gains because monitoring limits takeover related agency costs. Therefore, acquisitions create agency problems for minority shareholders of the target and bidder firms, when managers are not monitored.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003032 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2008.01759ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100003400072245008700106300005700193502004600250504005800296650002400354650002900378650005500407650005000462040002300512264006200535336002600597337002600623338003600649655003800685520061300723856003901336710010601375851011s1973    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.H373 1973  aFGME1 aHart, Howard Arthur.,eauthor14aThe impact of the managerial grid on organization change /cby Howard Arthur Hart.  a1 online resource (x, 207 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1973  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 198-207). 0aManagement science. 0aIndustrial organization. 7aIndustrial organization.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00971405 7aManagement science.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01007306  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1973  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThe Managerial Grid is examined as an organization development approach for a large manufacturing corporation.

These factors include self-efficacy, outcome expectations, personality traits, interest in computers, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and perceived IT job availability. The paper develops and tests a theoretical model based on social cognitive theory and the theory of planned behavior, and also incorporates the five factor model of personality. The intent of this study is to extend the social cognitive theory and theory of planned behavior literatures by expanding their application to IT career choice issues and by including personality traits as additional factors. The latter addition also indicates a unique application of the five factor personality model, as it is rarely used in concert with self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and broad environmental factors such as job market demands. A multi-section survey was administered to college undergraduates at four large universities in the southeastern United States. Analysis of the data results showed that college undergraduates with positive attitudes towards the IT major and high perceived behavioral control regarding the IT major had a greater intention of pursuing IT. The study also found positive links between 1) computer self-efficacy and self-evaluating outcome expectations regarding an IT career, 2) computer self-efficacy and perceived behavioral control, and 3) self-evaluating outcome expectations and attitudes towards the IT major. In addition, personality traits moderated a number of model relationships. Finally, it was found that males were significantly more likely to choose IT than females and scored higher on computer self-efficacy, self-evaluating outcome expectations, attitudes towards the IT major, interest in computers, and perceived behavioral control. The results and contributions of the study are discussed and recommendations are made for future research.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003042 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2007.01897ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100003500083245014800118300005700266502004600323504005600369650003200425650005000457651003800507040002300545264006200568336002600630337002600656338003600682655003800718520071800756856003901474710010601513851011s1972    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us-or 4aHF001b.H47 1972  aFGME1 aHerhold, Allen David.,eauthor13aAn investigation of real estate agents own professional image compared to his actual behavior in the state of Oregon /cby Allen David Herhold.  a1 online resource (vi, 93 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1972  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 91-93). 0aReal estate agentszOregon. 7aReal estate agents.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01090862 7aOregon.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204579  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1972  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThis thesis was prepared as a study of the real estate agent's own professional image compared to his actual behavior in the state of Oregon. Methods employed in substantiating this concept and its corollaries include: questionnaire, interviews, and scholarly research. The thesis is divided into two objectives, testing three hypotheses. The categories for measurement include breakdown in the agent's knowledge of technical aspects of conducting real estate transactions and a breakdown in performance due to a lack of follow-up on details to conclude a real estate transaction. After extensive analysis employing the projective technique, it was found that remedial programs should be instituted in both areas.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135042 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.02287ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003400071245010300105300005600208502004400264504005600308650002000364650001800384650002100402650004400423650004700467650004600514040002300560264006200583336002600645337002600671338003600697655003800733520109500771856003901866710008001905991020s1999    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001b.H48 1999  aFGME1 aHernandez, Ulises A.,eauthor10aStock prices and the money supply :btesting for information efficiency /cby Ulises A.

If we find that there is a lag between changes in variables that might affect the price of stocks, and the reflection of that change in its price, the market for stocks will be inefficient. This thesis tests the stock markets in six of the largest developed economies for informational efficiency. It tests the stock markets in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, The United Kingdom, and The United States, for the existence of a causal relationship between changes in the money supply and changes in stock prices, and applies the Granger-causality test to perform it. A stock market is informationally inefficient if a causal relationship between changes in the money supply and changes in stock prices is found. In this case, money supply changes could be used to predict movements in the prices of stocks, create profitable trading rules, and help us earn above-normal returns, thus casting doubts on the ability of the stock market to allocate funds efficiently.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/156272 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1999.02162ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003300071245010100104300005600205502004600261504005600307650003700363650006300400040002300463264006200486336002600548337002600574338003600600655003800636520108900674856003901763710010601802851004s1972    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.H63 1972  aFGME1 aHoffmann, Donald A.,eauthor10aIncome opportunities for a new national or expanding local association /cby Donald A.

What income producing service programs are available to build total revenue and enable an association to develop or expand? Interviews were held with key association executives to obtain their views. A fifteen question (one hundred part) questionnaire was developed from the results of the interviews and secondary research. It was mailed to a select list of different types of organizations, sixty percent of whose chief executive is a Certified Association Executive (CAE). Fourteen questions requested information about income sources in use or planned for use and the respondents personal opinion of associations today and their projected future. A list of income ideas was compiled from the replies. Question fifteen pertained to information on the respondent. The tabulated responses of the question reflect the importance of thorough executive selection. Association successes and failures are keyed to the chief executive's own innate abilities, experiences and influences.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135052 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.02969ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002300053049000900076100002900085245019300114300005700307502004600364504005600410650005200466650003700518650005200555650006200607650006300669650004800732651004500780040002300825264006200848336002600910337002600936338003600962655003800998520147801036856004302514710008602557080512s2007    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001.5b.H68 2007  aFGME1 aHoumes, Robert.,eauthor13aAn analysis of securities fraud class action lawsuits :bhow overvalued equity and related factors affect the likelihood of dismissals and the magnitude of settlements /cby Robert Houmes.  a1 online resource (xi, 74 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

Since lawsuits are costly, managers should be motivated to avoid a securities fraud class action. Prior research argues that managers attempt to mitigate the adverse effects of class actions by preempting negative eamings surprises (Skinner 1994 ). However, this study argues that when a firm is overvalued, managers have incentives to avoid value reducing disclosure, which may lead to the violation of securities fraud laws. I investigate this assertion by testing associations between overvalued equity and the two outcomes of a securities fraud class action: dismissals and settlements. Other relevant factors related to overvalued equity are also tested and measured. These other factors include cases where the lead plaintiff is an institution, the length of the class period, the intrinsic value of exercisable CEO in-the-money stock option holdings, and corporate governance as measured by a corporate governance score and the occurrence of a GAAP violation. Findings show that the likelihood of a non-dismissal increases when an institution is the lead plaintiff and CEOs of overvalued firms hold higher amounts of in-the-money options. In addition, results suggest that for overvalued firms, stronger governance increases the probability of a non-dismissal.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003052 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2007.01681ctm a2200241Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003300071245010900104300005800213502004600271504005800317650004400375040002300419264006200442336002600504337002600530338003600556655003800592520066400630856003901294710010601333920102s1977    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.H68 1977  aFGME1 aHoward, Giles W.

Profit warnings present important market information as to the recent past firm performance as well as a glimpse into the firm's future prospects. By implementing Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) in October 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) attempted to change the information environment by reducing information asymmetry between analysts and the investing public. This dissertation examines the impact of Regulation (FD) as it relates to three specific areas. Essay One examines Regulation FD's impact on market reaction to profit warnings by U.S. firms and finds significant market reaction over a two-day announcement window. The analysis in this dissertation documents statistically significant changes in the extent of the market reaction in the pre- and post-Regulation FD periods. Evidence is also presented that indicates a significant reduction in information leakage (as measured by negative cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) in stock price for firms in the two-week period immediately prior to a profit warning. Essay Two focuses on American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and examines differences in comparative market reaction (ADRs versus U.S. stocks) in the pre and post-Regulation FD periods. Essay Three tests the market reaction to profit warnings for commercial bank stocks in the pre- and post-Regulation FD periods with particular attention focused on the contagion effect. The empirical analysis in this dissertation seeks to answer the question of whether the implementation of Regulation FD successfully achieves the SEC's goal of reducing information asymmetry between analysts and investors.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FADT120092 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2002.03543ctm a2200337Ii 4500008004100000050002300041049000900064100004300073245008700116300005800203502004600261500001000307504005800317650003300375650002400408650003300432650002300465650005900488650005900547650005000606650004900656040002300705264006200728336002600790337002600816338003600842655003800878520216400916856003903080710008603119970407s1996    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001.5b.J33 1996  aFGME1 aJagannathan, Venkatakrishnan.,eauthor13aAn enhanced model for measuring service quality /cby Venkatakrishnan Jagannathan.  a1 online resource (xi, 160 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

These models are: (1) Perception minus Expectations (P-E) Model, (2) Ideal Point (IP) Model, and (3) Performance-based (P-based) model. Underlying the models are two types of attributes: (a) vector point attributes (in the P-E and P-based models), and (b) ideal point attributes (in the IP model). With vector point attributes, increasing performance levels produce increased levels of favorable evaluation by customers. With ideal point attributes, increased levels of performance produces favorable evaluation up to the ideal, but beyond the ideal further performance is unfavorably evaluated. This research extends the attribute typology by introducing a third type called the "threshold point attribute." Threshold point attributes are those where customers' evaluation are posited to be favorable when performance increases up to a threshold point. Beyond the threshold point increases in performance are not accompanied by incremental increases in favorable evaluation (as with vector attributes), nor do they turn negative (as with ideal point attributes). That is, the marginal change in evaluation (whether an increase or decrease) is zero after the threshold level. In addition to extending the attribute typology, this research also proposes an enhanced model which subsumes vector, ideal and threshold point attributes. Because of its inclusiveness, the enhanced model is hypothesized to better represent the construct of service quality than the P-E, IP, and P-based models. A survey was mailed to 4,975 customers of an internationally known service firm. Results of a piecewise regression analysis on the data show that threshold point attributes exist in services. The enhanced model, however, does not perform better than other models in criterion and construct validity tests. One significant implication for managers is that they can avoid expenditures on features that customers do not desire beyond a threshold level. The most important direction for future research is to develop and test a contingency theory of customers' attribute classifications.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/124862 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1996.03353ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002300041049000900064100003100073245011600104300005800220502004600278504005700324650003000381650002000411650005600431650004600487040002300533264006200556336002600618337002600644338003600670655003800706520220600744856003902950710008602989010425s2000    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001.5b.J65 2000  aFGME1 aJohnston, Jarrod.,eauthor14aThe impact of industry specific variables on the performance of initial public offerings /cby Jarrod Johnston.  a1 online resource (xi, 101 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

It has been widely accepted that IPOs perform well in the immediate aftermarket and perform poorly in the subsequent months. The uncertainty surrounding IPOs has been a frequently cited reason for the initial underpricing. The size of the offering, underwriter prestige, the number of uses of gross proceeds, and the level of inside ownership are a few of the variables that have been found to measure the uncertainty of IPOs across industries. The uncertainty of IPOs in different industries may also be affected by variables that are unique to that industry. The level of interest rates and the amount of regulation may affect the performance of existing financial service firms. The uncertainty of IPOs in the financial services industry may also be affected by these variables. This study finds that some financial service firm IPOs are affected by the level of interest rates. Some regulatory changes increase the uncertainty, and therefore the initial returns, of IPOs of financial service firms. The type of ownership structure affects the management of a firm due to differing agency costs. A mutual holding company (MHC) is a mutual company that issues a minority stake to the public. The MHC structure has been common among savings banks and is growing in popularity in the life insurance industry. The lack of takeover possibilities and stockholder control diminishes the risk taking behavior of MHCs in the thrift industry. Savings banks that choose the MHC structure experience lower initial returns without significant long run differences than savings banks that choose to convert to a completely stockholder owned bank. The operating characteristics may also affect the uncertainty of the firm. The internet allows firms to enter into an industry while having completely different operating structure than many of the other competitors. This study finds that firms that have an internet focus have higher initial returns than a matching set of IPOs. The changing environment, due to technology and low barriers to entry, increases the uncertainty of internet firms.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/126442 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2000.03082ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000050002300041049000900064100003500073245016300108300005800271502004600329504005800375650002000433650002100453650002700474650002400501650004600525650005300571650005000624650004700674040002300721264006200744336002600806337002600832338003600858655003800894520169900932856003902631710008602670990525s1997    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001.5b.J66 1997  aFGME1 aJones, Wesley M., Jr.,eauthor14aThe relationship between underwriter experience excess offering yield and underwriter compensation in the market for corporate debt /cby Wesley M.

A related objective of the firm's management that is consistent with this prime objective should be to minimize the cost of all inputs into the firm's income producing process. This would include minimizing the cost of the capital required to fund the firm's operations. This study examines the cost of debt to firms issuing new debt. Using a sample of new debt issues between 1988 and 1993 drawn from a listing compiled by the Capital Markets Division of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, this study finds that when underwriters are categorized by recent (last year) experience, the issuing firm's choice of an underwriter does not affect the offering yield required of the issuer in excess of several benchmark yields. Excess yield is tested with respect to 3-month treasury bills, 10-year constant maturity treasury securities, the average contemporary yield on AAA rated corporate bonds, and the average contemporary yield on new corporate issues carrying the same rating. The results do suggest that the issuing firm's choice of underwriter does affect the underwriter spread that the issuer will be charged. The implication of the results to corporate issuers of new debt is that choosing an experienced underwriter (defined in the study as having appeared in the listing of the top ten underwriters of corporate debt reported by Wall Street Journal in the previous year) could lead to reduced overall net interest costs stemming from the reduced underwriter spread.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/125212 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1997.04108ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002400053049000900077100003300086245006000119300005800179502004600237504005600283650003800339650003000377650003600407650004200443650004800485650006200533651004500595040002300640264006200663336002600725337002600751338003600777655003800813520280200851856004303653710008603696080416s2007    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001.5b.J679 2007  aFGME1 aJory, Surendranath.,eauthor10aThree essays on bankrupt firms /cby Surendranath Jory.  a1 online resource (x, 134 lleaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

The first essay examines the long-run performance of firms emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Once a firm files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it has to file a disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court. The statement details the company's current state of affairs and the factors that led to bankruptcy. The company also files a plan of reorganization. The plan details the company's debts and how the company plans to restructure and pay the debts. While operating under Chapter 11, the company makes regular disclosures of operating data to the court. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the company adopts fresh start reporting whereby its assets are reported at their net realizable values. Hence, the bankruptcy process provides the market with information that is useful in assessing the potential of the finn that is emerging from bankruptcy. As a result, post-bankruptcy, the performance of the firm should match expectation. Indeed, the evidence suggests that there is pricing efficiency after firms emerge from Chapter II bankruptcy and that they seem to perform properly when size, structure and risk are taken into account. The second essay examines the pricing of equity offerings by firms that emerged from Chapter II bankruptcy. In contrast to original IPOs, which are completely new to the market, post-bankruptcy equity offerings are performed by firms that were once publicly traded. Furthermore, while they are operating under Chapter II, the bankruptcy process provides information relevant in assessing the value of the firms upon their emergence from bankruptcy. Hence, there exists less information asymmetry in equity offerings by firms that emerged from bankruptcy compared to original IPOs. The reduced information asymmetry implies that the level of mispricing, if any, should be less in post-bankruptcy equity offerings than in original IPOs. Indeed, the results suggest that post-bankruptcy equity offerings are less underpriced than original IPOs and they are not subject to a reversal in returns in the long-run. The third essay examines the wealth effects of acquisitions of bankrupt assets to the acquiror's shareholders. Bankruptcy can lead to underpriced assets, lower costs of acquiring them and concessions from creditors of the bankrupt firm. These factors increase the net worth of acquiring bankrupt assets. Indeed, the results suggest that firms announcing acquisitions of bankrupt assets experience favorable wealth effects.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003062 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2007.02003ctm a2200349Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100003600083245013900119300005900258502004400317504005600361650002200417650003200439650001900471650003200490650005800522650004500580650005000625650004000675651003800715040002300753264006200776336002600838337002600864338003600890655003800926520057000964856003901534710008001573991022s1999    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  ae-gr---14aHF001b.K37 1999  aFGME1 aKarkalakos, Sotiris G.,eauthor10aTax revenues and public investment :bunidirectional or bi-directional causality? some empirical evidence /cby Sotiris G.

Internet-based advertising is neither given the focus on information and the ability to narrowly target such appeals (sites), as in direct marketing advertising. Given the emergence of Internet promotions, this is a substantial gap in our knowledge. This research seeks to both extend the boundaries of current direct marketing research (with its predominant focus on who will reply) and the domain of existing persuasion theories and models, attempting to gain a greater understanding of why consumers respond as they do to Internet advertising. By adapting the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to the Internet, this research attempts to determine if executional cues play a role in enhancing persuasiveness and the moderating effects of involvement. Additionally, this research draws on the substantial work on attitude towards the ad (A$\sb{\rm ad}$), including attempts to greater understand the antecedents of these attitudes and proposed distinctions between executional and content aspects of Internet ads, to see if this rich framework is useful in predicating outcomes for Internet advertising. This research has significant implications for practitioners as it looks beyond atheoretical testing-based insights of what people respond to, drawing on established theory to provide insights into why consumers respond as they do to Internet based advertising. Testing the adaptability of current persuasion theory to this emerging medium will do much to begin building a solid understanding of how Internet advertising works. Using an interactive computer-based simulation in a 2 (involvement) x 2 (argument strength) x 2 (peripheral cue: present or absent) between subject factorial design with 224 subjects the adaptability of existing persuasion research to the Internet was tested. Findings demonstrate the adaptability of the ELM to Internet advertising, as well as the important antecedent effects of attitudes towards Internet advertising on persuasion. However, the decomposition of A$\sb{\rm ad}$ proved less useful in this new domain. All told, much of what we currently know about persuasion is likely to prove useful in developing promotional campaigns for the Internet.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/125492 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1998.03600ctm a2200337Ii 4500008004100000050002300041049000900064100003800073245010500111300005700216502004600273500001000319504005800329650002200387650002300409650002300432650004000455650004900495650004800544650006600592650004900658040002300707264006200730336002600792337002600818338003600844655003800880520221900918856003903137710008603176950629s1994    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001.5b.K27 1994  aFGME1 aKaruppur, Devi Prasad R.,eauthor10aMarketing strategies in global markets :ba transaction cost analysis /cby Devi Prasad R.

One group of scholars recommends standardized global marketing strategies based on the premise that technological advances in telecommunication, transportation, and media are leading to similarities in customer preferences across the world. Other researchers recommend multi-domestic strategies on the premise that consumer heterogeneity continues to increase even within countries. Firms marketing products in global markets appear to adopt global marketing strategies, multi-domestic strategies, and various intermediate strategies that encompass different degrees of standardization. This research develops a theoretical framework to examine the factors that influence marketing strategies in global markets. Transaction cost analysis constructs are used to determine whether to standardize or customize marketing strategy. The basis for adopting different levels of standardization on marketing program and process variables is empirically investigated. A multinomial logit model is used to estimate the likelihood of adopting different degrees of standardization with data from American multinational corporations on 161 products marketed in different global markets. The results indicate that higher levels of asset specificity associated with patented technical knowledge favor physical attribute standardization in global markets. Volatile political environments, high degrees of ownership in affiliates, and global competitors' standardized marketing strategies encourage firms to tailor physical attributes. Brand names are standardized if the economic uncertainty is lower in foreign markets. Cultural dissimilarities between home and host countries hinder marketing control systems standardization. Operating experience in foreign countries and the need for technical service and customer interactions support standardization of marketing control systems. The need for specialized local market knowledge encourages the adoption of country-specific marketing research methods. Standardized pricing strategies are preferred over flexible country-specific strategies in volatile political environments.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/123792 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1994.03360ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002400041049000900065100002900074245006500103300005700168502004600225504007600271650003000347650002500377650005100402650005600453040002300509264006200532336002600594337002600620338003600646655003800682520223300720856004302953710008602996080408s2007    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001.5b.K387 2007  aFGME1 aKaushik, Abhay.,eauthor10aEssays on actively managed mutual funds /cby Abhay Kaushik.  a1 online resource (x, 180 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

My first essay analyzes the performance of sector funds across different stages of business cycles. Using a sample of 1,488 sector funds over the period 1990 to 2005, I demonstrate that sector funds perform differently across different stages in the business cycles. Average difference between expansion and recession cycles ranges from 2.75 percent per year to 3.78 percent per year. Findings of this essay further suggest that sector funds do exhibit different timing effects across recessions and expansions. Flow of funds and buy turnover ratio have differential effects across business cycles whereas sell turnover trading activities have a negative effect on funds' overall performance. My second essay analyzes the performance of "focus funds". These funds are well managed but tend to keep 50 or less stocks in their portfolio. Using a sample of 926 focus funds that existed during all or part of the period 1997 to 2006, I find that on average focus funds do not outperform a corresponding passive benchmark. My results further indicate that focus funds that are more concentrated in their top holdings, have larger net asset size, relatively young management and lower turnover ratios may offer higher abnormal returns compared to passive benchmarks. The third essay analyzes the effect of taxes and tax overhang on the flow of funds and performance in bond funds. Using a sample of 741 corporate bond funds that existed at some time during the period 1997 to 2006, findings of this essay indicate that new investors to bond funds are sensitive to unrealized capital gains/losses, however, the flow of funds is not affected by past dividend distributions. Findings further indicate that tax liabilities, unrealized gains/losses, and managerial tenure explain post-tax abnormal performance after controlling for investment style, and other known factors that explain the pre-tax performance ofbond funds.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003072 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2007.01718ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003000071245010900101300005700210502004600267504004100313650002800354650005400382040002300436264006200459336002600521337002600547338003600573655003800609520067200647856003901319710010601358840503s1983    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.K44 1983  aFGME1 aKelly, Norman H.,eauthor13aAn investigation into the use of the instruction set of the IBM Series/1 computer /cby Norman H.

Such instructions could possibly be vertically migrated into new single mnemonic hardware instructions, thus improving system performance. Two pairs of instructions were found which seem to be strong candidates for such vertical migration. Many instructions available on the Series/1 were not used in any of the modules examined. This suggests that some hardware instructions could be eliminated.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/141552 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1983.02198ctm a2200349Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100003100083245013800114300003900252502004000291500002300331504005800354650004200412650004200454650003500496650003500531650004600566650005300612651004500665651004500710040002300755264006200778336002600840337002600866338003600892655003800928520073700966856003901703710010601742821222r19821976xx      obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aK1331b.K46 1982  aFGME1 aKent, Derrence J.,eauthor10aTreasury stock and dividend policy :ba comparative study of British and American business philosophy and law /cby Derrence J.

The study reports that the announcements are associated with significantly positive abnormal returns (0.48 percent). The returns are more pronounced when the new CIO is hired from an IT leader firm (1.94 percent). Abnormal returns are significantly positive related with the CIO's level of education and high-technology firms, and negatively related with firm size. In addition, there is no significant difference in market reaction between the announcements that publicize the creation of a new position and those that imply the filling of an existing position with new hires. Further, the study finds an association between the appointment of the new CIO and subsequent improvement in the accounting measures of profitability. Findings reveal that CIO firms outperform their matched firms and their industry counterparts for the two years following the announcements relative to the year prior to the CIO appointment.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FADT120952 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2004.01858ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003200071245010500103300004100208502004400249504005600293650002800349650002000377650005400397650004600451040002300497264006200520336002600582337002600608338003600634655003800670520075300708856003901461710008001500980514s1997    xx      obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001b.K47 1997  aFGME1 aKinney, Timothy P.,eauthor10aStock prices and consumption :ba new variable in the consumption function? /cby Timothy P.

This study applies the methodologies of OLS regression analysis and tests of cointegration to examine the relationship between stock prices and consumption. The empirical results suggest that stock prices are a significant factor in the modified aggregate consumption function. Consumers, perceiving stock prices to be an indicator of their wealth, are making more expenditures on durable goods as they perceive increases in stock values to be permanent. Finally, the results of the tests for cointegration suggest that there is no long-run equilibrium relationship between stock prices and consumption.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/155042 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1997.02505ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003000071245008200101300004000183502004400223504005600267650002000323650002900343650002700372650005500399650005300454650004600507040002300553264006200576336002600638337002600664338003600690655003800726520131600764856004302080710008002123980520s1997    xx      obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001b.K57 1997  aFGME1 aKirk, Michael C.,eauthor10aStock market efficiency :ban international comparison /cby Michael C.

The presentation ofthis data is particularly prevalent when the level of stock market prices is in record territory. However, many believe that there exists no relationship, correlation or causal relationship between the level of stock market prices and macroeconomic indicators, especially in technologically advanced nations. The purpose ofthis paper is to test the efficiency of three international stock markets. If a stock market is efficient, all current information is instantaneously reflected in its price level. Since stock prices in an efficient market reflect all of the available information instantaneously, investors cannot profit by analyzing macroeconomic indicators. Thus, the implication is that there are no immediate profit-making opportunities in efficient markets and there are profit-making opportunities in less efficient markets. If the stock market ofthe United States is proven to be efficient, then the news media is incorrect in its presentation of macroeconomic data in order to predict an adjustment in the stock market.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003082 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1997.03822ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002300041049000900064100004100073245009700114300004100211502004600252504005800298650003000356650002000386650005600406650004600462040002300508264006200531336002600593337002600619338003600645655003800681520270000719856003903419710008603458990617s1997    xx      obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001.5b.K54 1997  aFGME1 aKnight, Rainford McWhinney.,eauthor13aAn empirical investigation of unit initial public offerings /cby Rainford McWhinney Knight.  a1 online resource (xv, 345 leaves ;)  bPh.

Specifically, the following areas are examined: (1) the underpricing unit IPOs relative to a subset of NASDAQ straight-equity IPOs; (2) the impact of the size and value of the overallotment option on the degree of underpricing and the underwriter percentage spread; (3) the impact of the size and value of the underwriter warrants on the degree of underpricing and the underwriter; (4) certification effects of auditor type and bank and bridge loans; (5) the distribution function of the underwriter; (6) the levels of financing packaged in the unit as a signal of firm quality, as well as, factors affecting the probability of packaging multiple levels of financing; (7) factors influencing the probability that the units offered will be detached into their component securities and (8) factors influencing unit bid-ask spreads. In general, the results indicate that unit IPOs are more underpriced than a similar subset of NASDAQ straight-equity IPOs. The excessive underpricing is reflective of the high degree of uncertainty surrounding these offerings. Also, the findings indicate that the degree of underpricing associated with unit offerings is influenced by the size of the offering, higher prestige unit underwriters and lower aftermarket volatility. Additionally, the value and size of the explicit options (the overallotment option and the underwriter warrants) granted in these offerings do not significantly impact the degree of unit underpricing. Furthermore, the evidence indicates the existence of certification benefits for those unit firms using big six/eight auditors and bank loans. In addition, the results imply that the underpricing of unit issues increases as the distribution effort of the underwriter decreases. Also, those unit firms packaging two levels of financing at the IPO (A and B warrants) seem to have a greater degree of uncertainty in comparison to those firms packaging only a single level of financing (A warrants only). For these firms, the probability of packaging multiple levels of financing is higher if the firm is underwritten on a best efforts basis and insiders retain a larger percentage of voting control. Similarly, the probability of a unit offering being detached into its component securities is greater with higher expected market making costs and a greater perception of firm value by the marketplace. Lastly, adverse information risk is greatest for the warrant component of detachable units. Furthermore, the findings indicate that underwriter stabilization and flipping seem to be infrequent events for the unit component.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/125082 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1997.02382ctm a2200349Ii 4500008004100000050002300041049000900064100004100073245014200114300005800256502004600314504005800360650004500418650004400463650003100507650002600538650004200564650006800606650005200674650007100726650005700797650007000854040002300924264006200947336002601009337002601035338003601061655003801097520076801135856004301903710008601946110511s2010    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001.5b.K56 2010  aFGME1 aKnoche, Harry "Trip",,cIII.eauthor14aThe effects of social structure on individual actions :ba social cognition and social structure approach /cby Harry "Trip" Knoche, III.  a1 online resource (ix, 194 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

The effects of epistemic motives and individual social structure on individual actions, the organizing process and the formulation and implementation of strategies are discussed.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003092 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2010.03646ctm a2200289Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002300053049000900076100003000085245005900115300005900174502004600233504005800279650006700337650002600404650003400430650002500464040002300489264006200512336002600574337002600600338003600626655003800662520253100700856003903231710008603270071114s2006    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001.5b.K65 2006  aFGME1 aKonku, Daniel K.,eauthor10aPenny stock IPOs as investments /cby Daniel K.

This study examines underpricing, short- and long-run performance of one special class of such low-priced stocks. I examine IPOs filed for and issued as Penny Stocks, as defined by the amended SEC Act of 1990. The study finds average first-day excess returns of 128% over a benchmark NASDAQ Decile 1 Index. The excess returns on nonpenny IPOs issued on the same markets as the penny stocks are 7.6% over the S&P 500 Index. Cross-sectional analyses show that lower-priced penny stocks and stocks of smaller firms are more highly underpriced. Consistent with the information asymmetry hypothesis, penny stocks that were issued on the pink sheets are more highly underpriced than those on the more exposed and more regulated environments of the NASDAQ Small Capitalization markets and the OTC markets. The short- and long-run performance analyses show that, in general, penny stocks have a high performance of between 18% to 20% raw returns in the first year of issue but that declines sharply after a 13-month period. I find an 11-month optimal holding period over which an investor could maximize his returns in a portfolio of penny stocks. I further show that a passive buy-and-hold investment in penny stocks held longer than this optimal period can be a poor investment but an actively-managed penny-stock portfolio can outperform comparable benchmark portfolios of various market indexes on both raw and risk-adjusted basis. Penny stock issuers have shifted from public issues to private placement since 2001. I examine the return to investors in these private issues during the lockup period or until those issues eventually end up in the public domain. The average annualized return to investors during the lockup period is 229%, with only 5% of those issues recording negative returns. Investors who bought these stocks immediately after the lockup period, however, experience an 11% drop in value but the trend reversed after about 10 months, indicating a better long-run performance than those initially issued on the public markets. I examine the effect of the Penny Stock Reform Act (1990) on the number of sanctions that were imposed on the penny stock issuers. The policy intervention analysis shows that the number of sanctions dropped by 9% in the immediate aftermath of the enactment of the Act but increased significantly by nearly 4.7% per quarter thereafter.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/122232 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2006.02143ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003100071245006900102300005900171502004400230504005600274650003000330650002000360650002000380650004600400650005600446650004600502040002300548264006200571336002600633337002600659338003600685655003800721520096300759856003901722710008001761980305s1997    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001b.K66 1997  aFGME1 aKonnan, Yehuda A.,eauthor10aDuration and the prices of common stocks /cby Yehuda A.

This concept has a number of applications in finance like calculating the change in the price of bonds due to the change in interest rates, immunizing the value of bonds, etc. Common stocks are also financial obligations and are considered to have durations. For bonds and similar strong contractual obligations, duration and its applications are clear cut and are used widely. For common stocks duration evaluation is difficult and its practical applications hardly exist. Moreover, there are no publications of numerical results where duration was applied to common stocks. These facts make it doubtful whether duration can be applied to common stocks. The results of the empirical research here, with numerical results, make it doubtful that duration can be applied to common stocks or to explain price fluctuations of common stocks.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/153682 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1997.03272ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000050002300041049000900064100003600073245011500109300006000224502004600284504005800330650004000388650002200428650002200450650004800472650004800520650006600568040002300634264006200657336002600719337002600745338003600771655003800807520200000845856003902845710008602884991019s1999    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001.5b.K74 1999  aFGME1 aKrishnamoorthy, Anand.,eauthor10aFirm specific factors and the exchange rate exposure of multinational corporations /cby Anand Krishnamoorthy.  a1 online resource (viii, 107 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

Exchange rate exposure is defined as the impact of unanticipated changes in exchange rates on stock prices. The motivation for the study lies in a fundamental discrepancy between academic research and practice: Academic research has shown that exchange-rate exposure is not priced in capital markets, but the use of financial hedging instruments designed to protect firms from unanticipated changes in exchange rates is widespread. This leads to the conclusion that exchange rate exposure is priced in equity markets and is a function of firm specific factors. This dissertation segregated firms based on various factors that might affect its exchange rate exposure. They are: A firms foreign sales characteristics, the export/import characteristics of the industry to which it belongs, the competitive structure of the firms industry, its business organization and its degree of concentration in sales. The results indicate that firms that operate in the service sector of the economy are more exposed to exchange rate risk than those that operate in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, the degree of competition among firms in an industry does not have an impact on exchange rate exposure. The results indicate that a firms degree of concentration in foreign sales has an impact on its exchange rate exposure. These results imply that restructuring operations can reduce a firms exchange rate risk. When taken together, the results of the dissertation indicate that exchange rate is exposure is priced in capital markets and is a function of firm specific factors. These results have implications for corporate investors and managers. Corporate investors can choose portfolios that will limit their exchange rate exposure. Corporate managers can make hedging decisions for the firm based on the degree of exposure the firm faces which is a function of who it is and what it does.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/125962 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1999.01920ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100003100083245010700114300005800221502004600279504005600325650004300381650003600424650005400460650006200514651004500576040002300621264006200644336002600706337002600732338003600758655003800794520064100832856003901473710010601512851004s1978    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001b.K83 1978  aFGME1 aKugler, George C.,eauthor10aFuture market prediction for electric powered automobiles in the United States /cby George C.

Due to their present limited performance, electric vehicles can replace only a fraction of present ICE automobiles. A quantitative estimate of the market for EV's over the next ten years is arrived at by considering EV performance levels, automobile driving and buying habits of United States automobile purchasers, and ownership statistics. A maximum market potential for electric automobiles of 30 percent of the new car market in ten years is derived.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/139442 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1978.02137ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002200053049000900075100003600084245011900120300005900239502004600298504005800344610004600402610007200448650006300520650007400583651004500657040002300702264006200725336002600787337002600813338003600839655003800875520077700913856003901690710010601729841113s1972    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001b.L329 1972  aFGME1 aLaGasse, Alfred Bazil.,eauthor12aA case study in the transferability of long-range planning within voluntary organizations /cAlfred Bazil LaGasse.  a1 online resource (vii, 172 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1972  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 170-172).20aAmerican Society of Landscape Architects.27aAmerican Society of Landscape Architects.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00542724 0aAssociations, institutions, etc.zUnited StatesxPlanning. 7aAssociations, institutions, etc.xPlanning.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00819207 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1972  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThis thesis was prepared as a case study of the American Society of Landscape Architects to determine the potential utility and transferability of long-range planning in voluntary organizations.

While research has documented the existence of market overreaction and under-reaction, it has not comprehensively addressed the underlying information releases that caused the extreme price fluctuations. This study controls for the underlying announcements, and finds that the degrees of overreaction and under-reaction vary according to the underlying information releases. A primary contribution of this dissertation is the finding that undefined events are associated with higher degrees of overreaction than defined events. The Wall Street Journal Index was used to determine if each event had an announcement that coincided with it. Defined events are those for which an underlying announcement was found in the Wall Street Journal Index. For undefined events, no announcement was found. This finding supports the theory of investor overconfidence and biased self-attribution by Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998). This study analyzes the overreaction and under-reaction phenomenon in three areas: international securities, domestic securities, and foreign currency. The international securities analyzed are American depository receipts and international closed-end funds. The domestic securities analyzed are financial and non-financial stocks. In the foreign currency area, currencies are classified into two types: emerging country currencies and industrial country currencies. In all of these areas, controlling for the underlying announcements is beneficial in understanding market overreaction and under-reaction. Finally, cross-sectional regression equations are employed to relate post-event returns or exchange rate changes to different variables, such as initial price change, pre-event information leakage, size (market value), month of the year (December or January), day of the week, and announcement type. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests larger initial price movements and prevent information leakage are associated with higher degrees of overreaction, and that the tendency towards overreaction is stronger for undefined events.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/125642 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1998.02839ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000050002400041049000900065100003000074245008600104300005800190502004600248504005800294515008700352650002900439650002400468650002200492650003600514650003800550650004200588650002500630040002300655264006200678336002600740337002600766338003600792655003800828520152200866856003902388710008602427060113s2005    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001.5b.L415 2005  aFGME1 aLeaptrott, John.,eauthor10aEntrepreneurial scanning behavior in new childcare ventures /cby John Leaptrott.  a1 online resource (xx, 270 leaves) :billustrations ;  bPh.

The first was the information search and analysis these entrepreneurs performed when they made certain basic decisions necessary to start most business prior to commencement of operations. The second was the ongoing information search activities of entrepreneurs who had started childcare businesses and were managing them in their first few years of operation. In addition, this dissertation assessed the extent these scanning activities were consistent with a dual process theory of reasoning. Finally, the limitations of the study and suggested future research directions for research of entrepreneurial scanning were discussed. The results suggest an entrepreneur's scanning behavior at the start of the business may be different from scanning behavior that occurs once the business has been operating for a period of time. The need for cognition, exposure to statistical thinking and intelligence (operationalized in this study as the amount of formal education) were positively related to the kind of information search and analysis undertaken by the entrepreneur at the startup of the business that Kahneman (2003) and others describe as System 2 reasoning. The accessibility of information and the amount of formal education were positively related to scanning that was done in periods subsequent to startup by these childcare entrepreneurs. Work-family conflict was negatively related to scanning during this period.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/121502 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2005.03776ctm a2200313Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002300053049000900076100003100085245014000116300005900256500001400315502004600329504005700375650004800432650004100480650005200521650005900573651004500632040002300677264006200700336002600762337002600788338003600814655003800850520244900888856003903337710008603376980421s1997    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us---14aHF001.5b.L42 1997  aFGME1 aLebron, Carlos J.,eauthor10aStudy of the persuasive effects of English versus Spanish language printed communications on Hispanic-Americans /cby Carlos J.

Five research hypotheses were developed drawing from the "social value" component of the Theory of Consumption Values of Sheth, J. N., B. I. Newman, and B. L. Gross. (1991. Consumption Values and Market Choices: Theory and Applications, Cincinnati, Ohio: South-Western Publishing Co.). An experiment was conducted with the language manipulation through a national mail survey. None of the following hypotheses were supported. (1) Hispanics will have a more positive attitude toward products advertised with the English language than to those advertised with the Spanish language. (2) Hispanics will have a more positive attitude toward socially visible products advertised with the English language than to those advertised with the Spanish language. (3) Hispanics will have a more positive attitude toward luxury products advertised with the English language than to those advertised with the Spanish language. (4) Lower socio-economic status Hispanics will have a more positive attitude toward products advertised with the English language than with the Spanish language. (5) Less acculturated Hispanics will have a more positive attitude toward products advertised with the English language than with the Spanish language. Overall, the results show that under a variety of conditions neither language clearly outperforms the other when dealing with printed advertisements directed to US Hispanics. Lower status and less acculturated Hispanics showed slightly more favorable attitude (than higher status and acculturated Hispanics) toward advertisements of any product regardless of the language used in the advertisement. Hispanics of any social class or acculturation level showed slightly more favorable attitudes toward products advertised in Spanish language regardless of whether the product is luxury, non-luxury, visible, or not visible. The main practical implication of the findings is that it might not be cost-effective or necessary to create a Spanish language printed promotional campaign in addition to an original English one to reach most US Hispanics. However, in the relatively less frequent situation where a substantial desirable segment of Hispanics is not exposed to the English media, it might be advantageous to use Spanish media with advertisements created in Spanish language.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/125092 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1997.02200ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003500071245010900106300004000215502004600255504005600301650003700357650006300394040002300457264006200480336002600542337002600568338003600594655003800630520113300668856003901801710010601840851010s1972    xx      obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.L69 1972  aFGME1 aLow, James Patterson.,eauthor10aMembers, leaders and rule by oligarchy in trade and professional associations /cby James Patterson Low.  a1 online resource (iv, 47 leaves ;)  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1972  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 46-47). 0aAssociations, institutions, etc. 7aAssociations, institutions, etc.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00819166  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1972  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aTrade and professional associations exist to benefit their members and the industry or profession they represent. In such organizations, one of the major problems is to keep the activities and policies of the association open to scrutiny by an input from the members. Two forces work against the easy solution of this problem: membership apathy and the development of rule by oligarchy. This thesis focuses on the functions and structures of trade and professional associations; on the characteristics of their members and leaders; and on the question of rule by oligarchy. The many functions performed by these associations, along with the complex structural constraints under which they operate are shown to have an affect upon their management. Member attitudes are explored and trends on critical issues compared over a six year period. The nature and role of association leaders are examined. Finally, the crucial problem of the emergence of oligarchical rule (rule by the few) is examined through the use of survey data relating to such things as member participation; leadership succession and access to leadership roles.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135082 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.03011ctm a2200337Ii 4500008004100000050002300041049000900064100003200073245010200105300004000207502004600247500001000293504005800303650002700361650002700388650001700415650002600432650005300458650005300511650004300564650005200607040002300659264006200682336002600744337002600770338003600796655003800832520167800870856003902548710008602587931102s1993    xx      obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001.5b.L97 1993  aFGME1 aLyroudi, Katerina.,eauthor14aThe dividend reinvestment plan puzzle, theoretical and empirical evidence /cby Katerina Lyroudi.  a1 online resource (x, 161 leaves ;)  bPh.

It develops a DRP theory, as an extension of dividend and capital structure theories. Furthermore, the study tests empirically several hypotheses related to the market reaction at the announcement of a DRP adoption, to the market reaction at the announcement of a DRP discontinuance and to the performance of the company sponsoring a DRP. The results indicated that the market reaction to the announcement of a DRP establishment is favorable on days 1 and 2, significant only for the latter. In the long-run, DRPs create value for the sponsoring firm and its shareholders (as measured by Tobin's Q). The announcement of a DRP termination is followed by a negative market reaction, consistent with the thesis of this study. Finally, several factors such as the DRP type (Type I and Type II plans), the industry of the sponsoring company (utilities and non-utilities), tax legislation, the discount feature and the dividend payout ratio are examined in relation to the market reaction at the announcement of a DRP adoption. The Type II DRPs create more favorable reaction to Type I plans at the announcement of their introduction. There are significant differences between the market reaction at the DRP introduction of utilities and non-utilities. The tax legislation affects corporate dividend policy and DRPs. Finally, the discount feature is not regarded favorably by investors as it was hypothesized, which explains its elimination from many DRPs in the recent years.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/123282 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f1993.02372ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100005300072245021000125300005800335502004600393504005100439650002600490650003700516650006300553650005200616040002300668264006200691336002600753337002600779338003600805655003800841520107000879856003901949710010601988851011s1973    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.M325 1973  aFGME1 aMacMillan, William L.,q(William Leedom)eauthor13aAn investigation of the multiple association management firm as an effective and economic alternative source of management for the smaller voluntary membership organization /cby William L.

A direct mail questionnaire was used to ascertain organization structure, size and income, services provided, and management method. A second questionnaire was sent to every identifiable multiple association management firm to determine experience of the firm and its principals, structure and income of voluntary organizations managed by these firms, whether or not these firms experienced an increase in the number of voluntary organizations managed and in the size of the firm, services they provide to voluntary organizations, and how their client voluntary organizations were previously managed. Secondary research consisted primarily of material published in association trade journals. Multiple association management firms were found to be increasing both in size and number, and more voluntary organizations appear to be selecting this form of management; the primary reasons for this selection are professionalism and cost.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135892 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1973.02419ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100003600083245021100119300004100330502004600371504005600417650004400473650004400517650005200561650005200613651004800665040002300713264006200736336002600798337002600824338003600850655003800886520104800924856003901972710010602011830830s1972    xx      obm   000 0 eng d  an-us-ia 4aHF001b.M37 1972  aFGME1 aMartin, Thomas Danial.,eauthor13aAn analysis of automobile and homeowners insurance programs of representative consumers in Des Moines, Iowa in determining their adequacy of coverage and understanding of product /cby Thomas Danial Martin.  a1 online resource (vii, 69 leaves ;)  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1972  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 65-66). 0aAutomobile insurancezIowazDes Moines. 0aHomeowners insurancezIowazDes Moines. 7aAutomobile insurance.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01715772 7aHomeowners insurance.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00959610 7aIowazDes Moines.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01205836  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1972  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThis thesis is an analysis and study of a random sample of Des Moines, Iowa consumers as to the types of Automobile and Homeowner insurances they have purchased, and their understanding of some pertinent coverage questions.

Through the use of a mail survey questionnaire, five hundred consumers were asked to participate in the survey. From the survey response, various consumer profiles were developed relating to respondents' sex, marital status, age, education and income. Cross references were then made in identifying these particular groups with the kinds and amounts of coverages they had purchased and their answers to certain coverage questions. The results of the study indicated that although the respondent group had purchased coverages more in line with insurance industry recommendations and requirements, they nevertheless were not as knowledgeable about the subject as they should be.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135102 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.01764ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003900071245014700110300005900257502004600316504005800362650003700420650001800457650001200475650006300487650004400550650003800594040002300632264006200655336002600717337002600743338003600769655003800805520047400843856003901317710010601356851011s1978    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.M38 1978  aFGME1 aMatthews, Gerald William.,eauthor12aA values study of voluntary financial contributors and non-contributors to an individual membership association /cby Gerald William Matthews.  a1 online resource (vii, 167 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1978  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 165-167). 0aAssociations, institutions, etc. 0aFund raising. 0aValues. 7aAssociations, institutions, etc.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00819166 7aFund raising.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00936143 7aValues.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01163906  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1978  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThis study attempts to explain the motivation for a voluntary financial gift through the analysis of individual value systems.

It deals with the factors that influence direct and indirect compensation and what special benefits and perquisites are made available to wage and management employees. A multiplicity of influences plays upon any determination of wages for the individual and the organization. These forces vary so in their impact that any static approach to wage criteria is misleading. The executive employee's compensation must contain both financial and non-financial elements designed to supply the urge, stimulus, and encouragement to improve profit performance and enhance the growth, expansion, and progress of the company. Since each form of compensation has both advantages and disadvantages they must be carefully weighed if they are to meet the short-term and long-term objectives of both the company and the employee.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135472 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.02182ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100002900072245007500101300005700176502004600233504005100279650003700330650001800367650006300385650004400448040002300492264006200515336002600577337002600603338003600629655003800665520105600703856003901759710010601798851010s1972    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.M398 1972  aFGME1 aMcGhee, Archie.,eauthor10aNew sources of income for accounting associations /cby Archie McGhee.  a1 online resource (iv, 57 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1972  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaf 57). 0aAssociations, institutions, etc. 0aFund raising. 7aAssociations, institutions, etc.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00819166 7aFund raising.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00936143  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1972  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aAccounting associations have been slower to develop non - dues income than have trade and other associations . Thirteen major accounting associations, excluding state C. P. A. societies, indicated that their rate of non-dues income varied directly with the association's membership. Only associations with less than one thousand members failed to conform to this pattern. In 1970, only the accounting associations with a 25,000 membership, or over, attained the level of non- dues income reported by trade and other associations in 1967. The sale of books and other publications was the greatest 1970 source of non-dues income; however , rising revenues from educational and training courses threaten this leadership position . Income from advertising and publication subscriptions increased; but advertising's taxability and the increased association scrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service may reduce emphasis in these areas. The threat of losing tax-exempt status could dempen future efforts to expand non-dues income for accounting associations .40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135112 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.02098ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002000053049000900073100003000082245007400112300004100186502004600227504005800273650005200331650002600383650006300409650005200472651004500524040002300569264006200592336002600654337002600680338003600706655003800742520087100780856003901651710010601690850103s1975    xx      obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001b.M4 1975  aFGME1 aMcKrell, John H.,eauthor10aManagement and the new breed hospital employee /cby John H.

This employee questions establishment mores, generally is not over 30 years of age, and has entered the labor force during the past five to eight years. Business, government, labor and philosophy are reviewed in terms of their influence on today's attitudes. A survey was conducted to determine the impact of new breed thinking on policies and practices. Factors surveyed included recruiting and hiring, training and promotions and career development, rules and regulations , supervisory practices and communications. The results of the survey indicated that employee policies and practices of the hospital industry were not significantly influenced by new breed thinking.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/137472 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1975.02109ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100003100072245007800103300005800181502004600239504005800285650003800343650004000381650006400421650006600485040002300551264006200574336002600636337002600662338003600688655003800724520092400762856003901686710010601725851024s1977    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.M543 1977  aFGME1 aMiller, Robert J.,eauthor10aFund raising in nonprofit fraternal organizations /cby Robert J.

The procedure involved a questionnaire to two groups of fraternity alumni, one being a group of officers, while the other was sent to one thousand alumni members selected at random. Profiles of the two groups were developed on the basis of age, education, occupation, income level, service as a fraternity officer, participation in fraternity meetings and readership of the organization's journal. The report summarizes the financial giving habits of both groups to several areas within the fraternity and to the colleges where the members received their undergraduate degrees . The results are expected to prove helpful to executives of nonprofit organizations involved in the solicitation of financial contributions.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/138722 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1977.01941ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100003300072245014200105300006000247502004600307504005800353650003000411650005600441040002300497264006200520336002600582337002600608338003600634655003800670520083400708856003901542710010601581851015s1973    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.M545 1973  aFGME1 aMilslagle, James E.,eauthor14aThe evaluation of fringe benefits as affected by characteristics of professional and non-professional employees /cby James E.

S. industry today, their value as motivators and need-satisfiers becomes significant. This study explores attitudes toward fringe benefits of scientists, engineers and other employees in one division of a large manufacturing company. In addition to a comparison between these groups, the influence of other factors; specifically age, length of service and earnings on employee attitudes was measured. The results showed significant differences between levels in the latter three categories and between professionals as compared to other employees. However, the evaluations of the two professional groups did not differ leading to the conclusion that other factors besides professionalism affect attitudes toward lower level safety-security or physiological needs.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135412 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1973.02440ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002200053049000900075100003600084245012800120300005900248502004600307504005800353650004200411650006000453651003800513040002300551264006200574336002600636337002600662338003600688655003800724520125500762856003902017710010602056851015s1976    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-mx--- 4aHF001b.M645 1976  aFGME1 aMolinar, Carlos Potts.,eauthor10aAlternative models for industry structure in l.p.

The Mexican government nationalized the petroleum industry in 1941 and in 1943 fixed the number of private enterprise L.P. distributors at forty. In 1950 the government set a top selling price to prevent unfair profits. The consumption of gas accelerated from a few wealthy families to the masses and with the alarming population boom and shifts in population many of the distributors' storage plants can no longer serve the public economically. Inflation increased operating and distributing costs to the point where many of the surviving thirty-two companies are operating at a loss. A survey of users was made to identify geographic demand today and in five years. A survey of the distributors was made for financial, organizational, and geographic analysis. Computer analysis was used to manipulate the projected data. A number of alternative models for private industry structure were constructed and the data used to project economic results of each. The study suggests various methods of combining private distributors to provide better service to the public while holding the selling price constant and optimize profits.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/137732 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1976.01762ctm a2200241Ii 4500008004100000050002300041049000900064100003300073245008400106300004000190502004600230504005600276650003000332650005600362040002300418264006200441336002600503337002600529338003600555655003800591520085200629856003901481961222s1989    xx      obm   000 0 eng d 4aPN2266b.M66 1989b  aFGME1 aMoore, Alan George.,eauthor10aFunding the performing arts in the late 80s and beyond /cby Alan George Moore.  a1 online resource (iv, 55 leaves ;)  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1989  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 54-55). 0aPerforming artsxFinance. 7aPerforming artsxFinance.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01057902  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1989  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aEvery year, performing arts organizations amass an ever-increasing chasm between ticket-generated income and contractually-obligated outgo. Traditionally, an individual or small group of individuals underwrote the shortfall. Today, however, no individual or small group can afford to underwrite these massive deficits, and organizations must go to the appropriate "capital" markets for funding. These "capital" markets--individuals, foundations, corporations, and governments--now provide well over half of the funding for not-for-profit opera, symphony, ballet, and theatre companies, and the percentage rises each year. For the performing arts to survive, arts administrators must increase the amount of support from present contributors and find new sources of funding at a time when revisions in the IRS Tax Code conspire to discourage giving.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/1454302196ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003300071245012200104300005900226502004400285504005600329650002100385650002600406650005200432650004700484040002300531264006200554336002600616337002600642338003600668655003800704520105700742856003901799710008001838990826s1999    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001b.M68 1999  aFGME1 aMourey, Kimberly A.,eauthor10aAdjustment of prices for quality change :ba hedonic analysis of domestic passenger airfare /cby Kimberly A.

This study employs a hedonic quality measurement technique to assess the effects of quality on domestic passenger airfare. The econometric analysis utilizes pooled quarterly data on average fare for the largest-share and the lowest-fare carriers, for each of the approximately top 1,000 routes from 1996:Q3 to 1998:Q2. The hedonic regression specifies airfare as a function of distance, total passengers, market share of the airline, and quality variables measuring on-time performance, oversales, baggage handling, complaints, and airline safety. Quality characteristics are found to have several important effects on airfare. Oversales revealed a statistically significant impact on airfare for all distance blocks, passenger complaints were important on short and long routes, and on-time performance and baggage handling were valued by customers only on shorter routes. Competition from low-fare carriers, and differences between airline groups are also identified to be important factors.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/156342 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1999.02105ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100002900071245019600100300004100296502004600337504005100383650002700434650001700461650002900478650005300507650005500560650004300615040002300658264006200681336002600743337002600769338003600795655003800831520078900869856003901658710010601697830310s1981    xx      obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.N37 1981  aFGME1 aNash, Robert L.,eauthor13aAn analysis of the organizational status of past chief elected officials and their perceived degree of influence on the policy-making decisions of volunteer associations /cby Robert L.

The study uses data warehousing and data mining to model the customer database to predict churn rates and suggest timely recommendations to increase customer retention and thereby increase overall profitability. The Naive Bayes algorithm for supervised learning was the prediction algorithm used for data modeling in the study. The data set used in the study consists of one hundred thousand real wireless customers. The study uses database tools such as Oracle database with data mining options and JDeveloper for implementing the models. The data model developed with the calibration data was used to predict the churn for the wireless customers along with the predictive accuracy and probabilities of the results.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/129922 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f2003.02136ctm a2200301Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003200071245010800103300004000211502004400251504005600295650001900351650002900370651003000399650004500429650005500474651005600529040002300585264006200608336002600670337002600696338003600722655003800758520091900796856003901715710008001754990628s1997    xx      obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001b.N57 1997  aFGME1 aNitsi, Elisavet I.,eauthor12aA cointegration test of purchasing power parity :bsome international evidence /cby Elisavet I.

Using the unit root test as well as cointegration techniques we have tested the PPP doctrine. The empirical results indicate that both effective exchange rate and consumer price index time series are nonstationary. Furthermore, the relationship between the effective exchange rate and the price level is shown to be in long run equilibrium in the United States, Canada, Japan and Italy but no evidence for PPP can be found for Germany, the United Kingdom and France. Thus, it can be claimed that the United States, Canada and Japan's markets allow the exchange rate to fluctuate freely as opposed to the European markets, since European economies are prone to disturbances (real shocks) that lead to permanent deviations from the PPP.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/155102 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1998.02035cam a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050001900041049000900060100004000069245017300109300004800282502003800330504005200368650003500420650005700455650006100512650008300573040002300656264006200679336002600741337002600767338003600793655003800829520074500867856003901612710010601651770603s1969    flub    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHV3006.F51bN6  aFGME1 aNorley, Dolores B.,,d1918-eauthor10aTesting the validity of the waiting lists of the State of FLorida's institutions for the retarded :bthe Sunland training centers and hospitals /cby Dolores B.

Efforts to provide the right climate for the development and encouragement of indigenous expertise will go a long way to enhance the job satisfaction of employees, particularly petroleum engineers in the petroleum industry, an industry requiring a high level technology and the largest national revenue earner. Concepts of motivation were used as a starting point to provide a broad integrative perspective to the study of job satisfaction of Nigerian Petroleum Engineers. Empirical results of comparison of job satisfaction of Petroleum Engineers in the private and public petroleum companies in Nigeria highlight the areas needing attention to improve the job satisfaction of these engineers. The results also show the general characteristics of the private petroleum companies vis-a-vis the public petroleum companies as at the time the study was made.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/140402 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1980.01682ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003000071245009900101300005700200502004600257504005100303650002100354650004700375040002300422264006200445336002600507337002600533338003600559655003800595520065000633856003901283710010601322810625s1977    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.O54 1977  aFGME1 aOlivera, Sergio.,eauthor12aA study of the impact of the corporate identity program on BNM employees /cby Sergio Olivera.  a1 online resource (vi, 74 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1977  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaf 74). 0aCorporate image. 7aCorporate image.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00879659  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1977  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aOn January 2, 1976, the Banco Nacional de Mexico S.A. launched a Corporate Identity Program to project a new image of the Company and its affiliated enterprises.

All too frequently such projects are inappropriate, are in conflict with already established programs, and perhaps if developed may well pose a burden on a given community's resources despite the commendable motives of the voluntary organization. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a simplified model procedure by which a given community can be surveyed as to the appropriateness of a given project as well as to judge the potential for financial viability. The procedure will be in keeping with the known precepts of effective community social and health planning.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/139092 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1978.02075ctm a2200325Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100002700072245010400099300005900203502004400262504005600306650002400362650004700386650002900433650004200462650007300504650005000577650005500627650006800682040002300750264006200773336002600835337002600861338003600887655003800923520066900961856003901630710008001669071213s2006    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.O925 2006  aFGME1 aOzair, Amber.,eauthor10aCausality between stock prices and exchange rates :ba case of the United States /cby Amber Ozair.  a1 online resource (viii, 69 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.S.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd2006  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 60-62). 0aEconometric models. 0aBusiness forecastingxMathematical models. 0aEfficient market theory. 0aStock exchangesxMathematical models. 7aBusiness forecastingxMathematical models.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00842702 7aEconometric models.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00901567 7aEfficient market theory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00903773 7aStock exchangesxMathematical models.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01133581  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c2006  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThis thesis investigates the direction of causality as well as short-run dynamics and long-run equilibrium relationship between stock prices and exchange rates using quarterly data for the period 1960:1--2004:4.

We propose that if this is not the case the volatility is due to a bubble. Hence, this is the general hypothesis from which several testable hypotheses are developed. A key issue in bubble research is the definition of fundamentals. In this work we assume that, in the long-run, operating revenues are the only source from which any payments can be made, including dividend payments. Therefore, if expectations are formulated correctly, on average, there has to be a relationship between changes in prices and changes in corporate revenues. Thus, we use different accounting variables as proxies for fundamentals. In addition, since the literature points to contagion of opinion as one of the causes for the creation of bubbles, we also examine the contemporaneous relationship between prices and several proxies for herding behavior. OLS, panel data analysis, and quantile regression are used to analyze the contemporaneous relationship between prices and fundamentals or contagion proxies; while cointegration (reconciled to be used with panel data) and the Bonferroni inequality are used to investigate the long-run equilibrium between prices and fundamentals. The results indicate that, overall, company earnings are not explanatory of prices. These findings hold both in the short-run and in the long-run equilibrium scenarios. In addition, we find that investors do not reward an increase of the debt in the capital structure of corporations. In reference to our contagion variables, changes in money flow, volume, and volatility are found explanatory of changes in prices. Nevertheless, the effect of these variables is not homogeneous across price changes. Specifically, Money Flow is significant across all quantiles except for the 30% lowest price changes, Volume is explanatory of the 35% highest price changes, while volatility is explanatory across all the distribution of price changes. An interesting observation is that the three independent variables become increasingly explanatory as we move up to higher quantiles. Taken together our findings are supportive of the bubble and contagion hypotheses.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/126432 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kDoctoral dissertation,f2000.02115ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100002800071245012100099300005800220502004600278504005100324650003700375650002000412650006300432650004600495040002300541264006200564336002600626337002600652338003600678655003800714520094000752856003901692710010601731851015s1977    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.P72 1977  aFGME1 aPrast, John J.,eauthor14aThe development of an evaluation system of members' performance within a voluntary organization /cby John J.

Western European hotels and convention facilities must improve to meet the standards of American association executives. Language barriers and distance are two barriers which are being overcome. There is evidence that continued progress will be made in resolving the technical barriers which have caused American associations to stay within the United States.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/137742 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1976.01874ctm a2200241Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100003100072245007300103300004200176502004600218504005600264650005000320040002300370264006200393336002600455337002600481338003600507655003800543520090600581856003901487710010601526851015s1976    xx      obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.R575 1976  aFGME1 aRitchie, James I.,eauthor10aFinancing the trucking industry associations /cby James I.

Many studies have sought to .identify -those factors other than financial capability which motivate members of these associations to join, belong and participate. This study sought to determine the relationship of the size of a business, its profitability, or the degree of concentration to the financial support given the industry associations. The procedure involved a review of the relevant literature, and primary research involving a national federation of fifty state trucking associations in the United States. Results of the study indicate members of associations join, belong and contribute financial support to their associations for reasons in addition to demonstrated financial capability.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/137762 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1976.01942ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000050002200041049000900063100003300072245015900105300005900264502004600323504005600369650003000425650002800455040002300483264006200506336002600568337002600594338003600620655003800656520084900694856003901543710010601582851023s1973    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.R673 1973  aFGME1 aRose, James Joseph.,eauthor12aA case study of leakages of contributions to negotiated fringe benefit trust funds in the southern California plastering industry /cby James Joseph Rose.  a1 online resource (viii, 90 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1973  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 89-90). 0aDisclosure in accounting. 0aPlasteringxIndustries.  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1973  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThis study was prepared as the thesis required for the Master of Business Administration Degree.

Records of fringe benefit trusts of three inter-related crafts of the plastering industry (lathing, plastering and plaster tending) in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, California, were examined. Comparative analyses of union membership, employment statistics, hours reported for fringe benefit trusts and actuarial assumptions were made. Arbitration and judicial decisions were cited. After extensive analysis it was determined that leakages of fringe benefit contributions have occurred in significant amounts.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135542 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1973.02182ctm a2200289Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002200053049000900075100003000084245011400114300005700228502004600285504005800331610003300389610005900422650004400481650005600525040002300581264006200604336002600666337002600692338003600718655003800754520095500792856003901747710010601786841206s1973    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d  an-us--- 4aHF001b.R675 1973  aFGME1 aRoss, William C.,eauthor12aA study of control through a management by objectives system in the American Red Cross /cby William C.

Very little had been written on the management of voluntary organizations. The American Red Cross currently uses a system termed Objectives and Goals to establish priorities of service and periodically measure accomplishments. The problem area was whether the fundamental concepts of management by objectives as applied to the system used by the organization accomplished the measurement and correction of the performance of staff through a system of control. Secondary research concentrated on common practice and theory of the function of control and the system of management by objectives. Current manuals and instructions on Objectives and Goals issued by the American Red Cross were used for comparison. It was found that this system has the basic format of management by objectives but, as practiced, does not appear to function as a process of control.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135832 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1973.02626ctm a2200385Ii 4500008004100000043002100041050002100062049000900083100003900092245015000131300004200281502004400323504005700367650003800424650002900462651004600491651003700537650004200574650003300616650004900649650004800698650005300746651003600799651004500835648002100880040002300901264006200924336002600986337002601012338003601038655003801074520100501112856004302117710008002160980904s1997    xx      obm   000 0 eng d  acl-----aa------14aHF001b.S24 1997  aFGME1 aSalomé, Helena Johanna.,eauthor10aPrivate capital flows and economic development :ba cross-sectional analysis of Asian and Latin American countries /cby Helena Johanna Salomé.  a1 online resource (vii, 102 leaves ;)  bM.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1997  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 98-102). 0aCapital movementszLatin America. 0aCapital movementszAsia. 0aLatin AmericaxEconomic conditionsy1982- 0aAsiaxEconomic conditionsy1945- 0aSaving and investmentzLatin America. 0aSaving and investmentzAsia. 7aCapital movements.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00846374 7aEconomic history.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00901974 7aSaving and investment.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01105959 7aAsia.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01240495 7aLatin America.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01245945 7aSince 19452fast  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1997  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aAfter the 1980s debt crisis had officially come to an end, most developing nations in Asia and Latin America successfully reentered the global capital market. Private capital flows into these regions surged to unprecedented heights. Present paper gives an overview of what gave rise to this sudden come-back of external finance to the developing world, why its composition and geographical dispersion had changed, and how it affected the macroeconomic environment of the recipient nation. Furthermore, a cross-section econometric analysis is applied to thirty-four countries for the early 1990s, to determine the effect of private inflows on the growth rate of real GDP, as a proxy for economic development, in the context of a standard neoclassical growth equation framework. Results confirm the favorable impact of portfolio investment, but foreign direct investment appears to hinder economic growth. An attempt is made to interpret these results and compare them with existing empirical research.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003102 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1997.01637ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100004400071245007600115300005800191502004600249504005200295650002500347650004900372650005100421650007500472040002300547264006200570336002600632337002600658338003600684655003800720520045600758856003901214710010601253851015s1971    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.S36 1971  aFGME1 aSanford, Donald Gordon,,d1938-eauthor10aBusiness systems simulation using GPSS/360 /cby Donald Gordon Sanford.  a1 online resource (ix, 121 leaves) :billustrations ;  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1971  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaf 121). 0aComputer simulation. 0aProgramming languages (Electronic computers) 7aComputer simulation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00872518 7aProgramming languages (Electronic computers)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01078704  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1971  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThis thesis was prepared as an introductory text in business systems simulation using the General Purpose Simulation System/360 computer programming language.

Similarly, members or potential members seek specific values in that association, values seen as desirable. The effective match of the image projected by the association and the values sought (or, image perceived as desirable) by members and potential members will correspond to the relative success of the association in its membership recruitment and retention. This is studied by formulating the above as a hypothesis and testing it through correlation analysis. Data was generated by a survey of chief staff executives of 500 trade and professional associations.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/138612 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1977.02027ctm a2200265Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003600071245010800107300004000215502004600255504005800301610004900359650002300408650005300431040002300484264006200507336002600569337002600595338003600621655003800657520092100695856003901616710010601655841220s1972    xx      obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.S53 1972  aFGME1 aSiegfried, Clarence A.,eauthor10aApplicability of PPBS as a management tool in a selected trade association /cby Clarence A.

This was done by developing an understanding of what PPBS is and of how it has been applied in the Federal, state and local governments as well as in private industry. From what was learned in this review of PPBS, the characteristics and practices of PPBS seem most appropriate to the management needs of the American Rental Association, Inc., and it could be an effective management tool in other associations. This was shown by abstracting the key features from the system developed for the American Rental Association, Inc., and examining their applicability in other selected associations. The conclusion emerged that other associations can effectively use PPBS as an improved management tool.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/135172 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1972.01604ctm a2200253Ii 4500008004100000050002000041049000900061100002900070245008900099300005700188502004600245504005800291650002400349650005000373040002300423264006200446336002600508337002600534338003600560655003800596520057100634856003901205710010601244851028s1978    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.S6 1978  aFGME1 aSmith, Almon R.,eauthor10aRecruiting and training techniques of real estate salespersons /cby Almon R.

A survey was conducted of both brokers and new salespersons to evaluate recruiting methods, early training and supervision methods, and the amount of time a salesperson devoted to the job. This thesis presents the data obtained from the survey and evaluates the results.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/139462 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1978.01895ctm a2200265Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100003000071245006300101300003900164502004400203504005600247650001900303650002600322650005200348650004500400040002300445264006200468336002600530337002600556338003600582655003800618520093400656856003901590990823s1999    xx      obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001b.S73 1999  aFGME1 aStewart, John R.,eauthor10aHuman capital and endogenous growth /cby John R.

Human capital is assumed to be the basis of such growth, therefore, the focus is not on technological change per se. Through empirical analysis, human capital is measured by knowledge, and that the accumulation of knowledge, or specialization, is determined through an incentive system. The incentive system, in turn, is determined by the difference in wages paid to certain types of knowledge, those being a general level and a specialized level of knowledge. It is assumed that the learning process can take place at any time, therefore, the specialization process is not limited to an academic environment. A spillover effect associated with specialized knowledge provides for increasing returns to scale in the model, which is also supported by empirical data.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/1565901900ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100002600071245006800097300004100165502004400206504005600250650002000306650004100326650004600367650006700413040002300480264006200503336002600565337002600591338003600617655003800653520081200691856003901503710008001542970610s1996    xx      obm   000 0 eng d14aHF001b.T36 1996  aFGME1 aTan, Feifei.,eauthor12aA test of market efficiency using arch models /cby Feifei Tan.  a1 online resource (vii, 48 leaves ;)  bM.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1996  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 44-48). 0aFutures market. 0aStock exchangesxEconometric models. 7aFutures market.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00936766 7aStock exchangesxEconometric models.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01133571  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1996  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThe purpose of this thesis is to examine the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) employing an ARCH model proposed by Engle (1982). The relations of the US stock market and other five major stock markets, i.e., the Canadian, French, German, Japanese, and UK markets are investigated. The time series used in this study are monthly stock price and dividend indices for the above six stock markets. The data cover the period from January 1970 to March 1991. In this study I utilize the ARCH model which appears to be very powerful in modeling conditional heteroscedasticity of stock prices. My test results provide unambiguous evidence of significant ARCH effects existing between the six national stock markets. Therefore, this study demonstrates the existence of market inefficiency for these national markets.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/153492 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f1996.02116ctm a2200313Ii 4500008004100000043001200041050002100053049000900074100003000083245010200113300004100215502004600256504005600302610005300358610007000411650003700481650005600518651003700574040002300611264006200634264001100696336002600707337002600733338003600759655003800795520082400833856003901657710010601696841108t19761975xx      obm   000 0 eng d  an-us-tx 4aHF001b.T68 1976  aFGME1 aTownsend, Terry.,eauthor12aA profile of the leadership of Texas Motor Transportation Association, Inc. /cby Terry Townsend.  a1 online resource (vii, 76 leaves ;)  bM.B.A.cFlorida Atlantic Universityd1976  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 74-76).20aTexas Motor Transportation AssociationxHistory.27aTexas Motor Transportation Association.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00619203 0aTruckingzTexasxSocieties, etc. 7aTruckingxSocieties, etc.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01157762 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336  aFGMbengcFGMerda 1aBoca Raton, Florida :bFlorida Atlantic University,c1976 4c©1975  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier 4aElectronic Thesis or Dissertation3 aThis thesis is a study of the profiles of chief executives of motor truck and bus companies and allied industry companies who are members of their state association, the Texas Motor Transportation Association, Inc. The profiles were obtained from questionnaires received from 250 responding member chief executives out of the total membership of 921. From what was learned in a review of the questionnaires, characteristics were determined for each discipline of operation and for the entire association leadership. These indicated the makeup of the leadership, their interest areas in the association, and what they perceived to be the future needs of the industry. The conclusion emerged that such a profile can be an appropriate management tool for both the association and the individual members of the association.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fcla/dt/137632 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business and Public Administration.tMaster's thesis,f1976.02047ctm a2200277Ii 4500008004100000050002100041049000900062100002800071245018100099300005700280502004600337504005800383650003100441650003800472650006400510650005700574040002300631264006200654336002600716337002600742338003600768655003800804520078200842856003901624710010601663851029s1972    xx a    obm   000 0 eng d 4aHF001b.T74 1972  aFGME1 aTrew, David C.,eauthor13aAn area survey comparing selected personnel activities between those acute general, non-profit hospitals with and those without collective bargaining units /cby David C.

The survey included two states with specific labor laws requiring hospitals to bargain collectively and two states without specific legislation and contemplating the passing of such legislation.

To determine what are currently regarded as 'best practice' applications of: a. Job Identification Forecasts b. Human Resources Inventories c. Matching Jobs and Manpower 2. To ascertain to what extent these 'best practice' concepts were actually followed in organizations operating in Alberta; and whether or not such practices could serve as examples for others.

Ifthis is true, when studying organizations perhaps more effort should be given to examining the effects of the structure of social relations within the firm . This study has attempted to take the first steps in beginning to systematically study identifiable and predictable effects of the informal structure of relations on the behavior of individuals. During the process of examining the etfects of epistemic motives and individual social structure on the actions of individuals, two important questions were addressed. First, what are the effects of epistemic motives on the formation of individual social structure? The findings of this study suggest that the need for closure and the need for cognition affect the formation of individual social structure in different and identifiable ways. In addition, the level of epistemic motivation atiects the degree to which social interactions affect tie strength. The second question is what are the effects of individual social structures on individual actions? The findings of this study suggest that the tie strength of an individual's social structure appears to affect interdependent actions; but, tie strength does not affect independent actions. In addition, an understanding about individuals' inclinations to take interdependent or independent actions is enhanced when the effects of both epistemic motives and social structure are considered. The findings of this study suggest that information about the epistemic motives of employees can provide insight into the fonnation of the individual social structures and the intrinsic desire of employees to take interdependent or independent actions. The effects of epistemic motives and individual social structure on individual actions, the organizing process and the formulation and implementation of strategies are discussed.40uhttp://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA000003112 aFlorida Atlantic University.bCollege of Business.kMaster's thesis,f2008.
